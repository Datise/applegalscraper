				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

If the guarantors do not pay the loan, the bank can seize and sell the assets of the business and take the money it is owed from the proceeds. Any money remaining after the sale of the assets must be returned to the business. If the business assets are not sufficient to repay the bank loan, the bank can take legal action against the guarantors.
Borrowing money for a business can be complicated and has serious ramifications if the loan is not repaid. Before signing any agreements with the bank, you should seek legal assistance from a lawyer.

There are four ways to change your name.  First, you can assume your spouse's surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.  Second, you can legally change your surname based on marital status by completing an Election to Change Surname form. The right to change one's surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
Third, you can change your entire name for any other reason by com","
				Many people change their name when they get married, as well as for other personal or professional reasons.  There are different procedures involved in changing a person's name depending on their age and the circumstances under which they want it changed.
There are four ways to change your name.  First, you can assume your spouse's surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.  Second, you can legally change your surname based on marital status by completing an Election to Change Surname form. The right to change one's surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
Third, you can change your entire name for any other reason by completing An Application to Change an Adult's Name.  Last, you can apply to change your child's name by completing An Application to Change a Child's Name.  Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
The law governing name changes is the Change of Name Act.  All change of name applications are submitted to the Registrar General's office at:
Office of the Registrar General
PO Box 3000
189 Red River Road
Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5W0
Assuming your spouse's surname upon marriage and resuming your former surname upon divorce or death of spouse
When you get married, you can change your last name by assuming your spouse's last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name). To use this assumed name you do not need to make an application.
By using your government issued marriage certificate, and other government documents to prove your identity, Canadian citizenship and that you are an Ontario resident, you can obtain a new dirver's licence and health card. There is no cost to complete this type of surname change. Once you have a driver's licence with your new assumed surname, you will be able to use your assumed name on your bank accounts and conduct other business under this new name. This type of name change will not change the surname on your birth certificate.
If you get a divorce or annulment, or upon the death of your spouse, you may once again resume using the surname you had immediately prior to your marriage.  Because you assumed your spouse's surname and did not formally change your surname, you do not need to complete a formal application to resume using your previous name. In order to change your surname on government documents, such as a driver's licence, you will need to show your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate) together with documents (such as a birth certificate) showing the name you want to resume using.
 
Legally changing your last name upon marriage:
Election to Change Surname form
Upon marriage, in addition to the right to assume your spouse's surname, you have the right to legally change your last name to your spouse’s last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name) by completing the Election to Change Surname form. Unlike assuming your spouse's surname, this type of name change will appear on your Ontario birth certificate. You may also change your last name while you are living with a person in a conjugal relationship outside marriage. This applies to both opposite sex or same couples.
To legally change your last name upon marriage, you will need to complete the Election to Change Surname form, which applies to both those who are legally married and to those living in a common-law relationship.  There is no fee to submit this type of application provided you do so within 90 days of being married or of filing a joint declaration of conjugal relationship. After 90 days, the fee is $25. This form is only obtainable by calling 1-800-461-2156. In addition to completing this form, you will need to provide:

Your marriage certificate, or if living common-law, a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form
Birth Certificate(s)
Change of Name Certificate(s) (if applicable)
Police records check (if applicable)

After your application is processed you will receive a letter confirming the change.  You will then need to order a new Ontario birth certificate, which will show your new name as well as your previous name.  You will also be able to obtain other Ontario government issued documents, such as a driver's licence and health card, which will show your new surname.
 
Legally change your last name after divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse:
Election to Resume Former Surname form
After a marriage is dissolved by either a divorce, annulment or the death of your spouse, you may resume using the surname you had immediately before marriage.  If you legally changed your last name to that of your spouse by completing the Election to Change Surname form (as opposed to simply assuming your spouse's surname), then you will need to complete the Election to Resume Former Surname form.
In addition to the form, you will need to submit a copy of your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate), your change of name certificate, and your birth certificate, and submit these together with the $25 fee. This form can only be obtained by calling the Registrar General's office at 1-800-461-2156. Once the change has been completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.
It is important to know that the Election to Resume Former Surname application must be submitted within 90 days of the dissolution of your marriage, otherwise, you will be required to file a formal name change using the Application to Change an Adult's Name form, which is a longer application process.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage:
Application to Change an Adult's Name
The Application to Change an Adult's Name is used to change your name for other than martial reasons. With this type of application you can change all of your names, as opposed to only your surname. The fee is $137. This type of name change will change the name on your Ontario birth certificate. The form is available online at ontario.ca
To change your name for a reason other than marriage, you must be:•

16 years of age or older, and
have lived in Ontario for at least one year before submitting the application.

In addition to completing the form, you will be required to submit other documents such as:

if born in Canada, original birth certificate (or certified copy),
copy of marriage certificate (if you are currently married) or a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form (if you are living common-law)
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If you are 16 or 17 years old, and you are married, you can complete this application without the consent of your parents or guardian.  You will, however, need to submit proof of your marriage. If you are 16 or 17 years old and not married, you will need to obtain permission from your parents, guardians or anyone who has legal custody of you before you can change your name.
Once the name change is completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.

Changing a child’s last name
If you want to change the name of a child who is 17 years of age or younger and has lived in Ontario for at least the past 12 months, you must submit an Application to Change a Child's Name.  You must have legal custody of the child, and the child must be unmarried.  As with the adult application, this form can be obtained online at ontario.ca.  The fee to change a child's name is $22 for each child if they change their names at the same time as one of their parents.
In addition to the application form and the fee, you will need to submit other documents, such as:

birth certificate (or certified copy),
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If a child 16 or 17 years old would like to change their name on their own, they can do so if they are married, or if unmarried, as long as they have the written consent of their parents, legal guardian, or anyone who has legal custody of them. In either case, they need to use the Application to Change an Adult's Name and pay the $137 fee.
For more information on changing your name, you can call the Office of the Registrar General in Toronto at 416-325-8305 or toll-free 1-800-461-2156. Or visit ontario.ca.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations
Public foundations
Private foundations

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public's perspective.
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario guide on charitable status.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Child support,117,"
				If parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, the other parent is usually responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support.

				If parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, the other parent is usually responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of eighteen. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent's rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of 18 if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a ""father"" for the purposes of paying child support.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government  family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments and is based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the Ontario or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Ontario Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Ontario, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

As mentioned, the type of parenting arrangement, for example whether there is split, sole or joint custody, also affects the amount of child support paid.
The rules determining income can be complex but usually are calculated on a spouse's total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use these guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997 is neither deducted from the payer's income nor added to the recipient's income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997 these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don't want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement, for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.
More information is also available from the federal Department of Justice.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				The Ontario government has established a number of rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child.

Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Birth parents must register the birth of their child within 30 days of the birth, giving the child a legal identity and ensuring that the child will get certain documents, such as a birth certificate and a passport. The child must be at least seven days old before written permission for adoption can be given and the natural parents then have 21 days to change their mind and cancel the permission. If permission is cancelled within the 21 days, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the 21 days has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their mind about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents' consent.
 
How to adopt a child in Ontario
There are generally two ways to adopt a child in Ontario. The first is a public adoption through the Children's Aid Society. The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licenced by the Ontario Government.
To adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved the Society will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the adoption order is given by the court. There is no cost for parents to adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society public adoption process.
The process to adopt a child through a private agency is very similar to that of adopting a child through the Children's Aid Society. For a private adoption, you must contact a private adoption practitioner that has been approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. In addition, you will be charged a fee for the private services, which is generally between $15,000 and $25,000.
 
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, you do not need to go through the Children's Aid Society or a private adoption agency. However, you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order. An assessment by an adoption practitioner is not needed for this type of adoption, unless the judge requires it.
However, if you wish to adopt a family member who lives outside Canada, there are a number of steps you must take, including:

complete a homestudy assessment and training program,
be approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services,
apply through an Ontario agency licensed to handle adoptions in the child's home country, and
submit an application to Canadian immigration to get permission for your adopted child to move to Canada.

 
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 - Adopting a child from abroad.
 
The approval process for all adoptions
Ontario residents are required to complete two programs as part of the approval process for either a private, public or international adoption:
1) The Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) homestudy is completed by licensed social workers approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services before approving the arrangements for the adoption. The purpose of homestudy is to assess the ability of the applicants to parent an adopted child, and involves discussions with an adoption worker about the adoptive parents attitudes towards parenting as well as exploring their values and beliefs. It can include references, medical reports and other personal information.
2) The Parent Resources for Information and Development and Education (PRIDE) program is a standardized training program to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child. The curriculum involves a variety of areas such as: the importance of connections to the child's birth family and kin, and the importance of cultural and racial awareness.
For more information about adopting a child in Ontario, contact the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For legal advice and assistance, contact a lawyer.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

				Canada's Anti-terrorism Act, 2015 (the Act) received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015.
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
 
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law. First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three continuous years. Second, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living together by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether one person was financially supporting the other person, whether they have had a sexual relationship and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common-law spouse.
Social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for social assistance and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse's income on your application for benefits. Under the social assistance and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for three months, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse's employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under the Ontario Human Rights Code. It is important to note that the Human Rights Code is not applicable to matters between private parties so only government plans that exclude same-sex couples will be subject to constitutional challenges. However, in union situations, if the collective agreement contains specific provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, exclusion of same-sex couples from the employee benefit plan would be a violation of the agreement. You should check with your personnel department for information on your employee benefit plan.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

Harassment is also a form of discrimination. Harassment means that the 'harasser' acts in an annoying or abusive manner that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the other person.
Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"

Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as 'offer and acceptance'. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.

Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.

When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation - a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake - where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence - when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity - those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.

Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.

 
How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, in Ontario, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in the Consumer Protection Act and the Sale of Goods Act. In an attempt to protect consumers, these Acts set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, the Employment Standards Act applies. The provisions of the Act contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected. See topic 240 Employment contracts in this section of Legal Line for more information.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.
For more information about the responsibilities of a business under the Ontario Consumer Protection Act, refer to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

Ontario Disability Support Program
People who are considered disabled according to the government's definition, can receive financial support and help finding a job through the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). To be eligible for disability benefits, you must complete the application process, which includes medical examinations.
Under the Ontario Disability Support Program, the amount you receive depends on your living arrangement.  It is made up of two portions: Income Support and Employment Support.
Income Support is meant to supplement other income. The basic needs portion of Income Support is meant to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and other necessary personal items. The amount you receive is based on a number of factors, including the number of people in your family and the age of your family members, where you live and how much you pay to live there, and your income and any assets you may have. The shelter allowance portion of the Income Support is meant to help cover such things as: rent or your mortgage payments, heat and utilities;  and is based on your actual shelter costs up to a maximum depending on the number of people in your family. Those who qualify for Income Support may also be eligible for other benefits such as drug and dental coverage, vision care, help with transportation costs, and wheelchair/mobility devise repairs and batteries.
Employment Support is also provided and helps people with disabilities, who can and want to work, prepare for and find a job.
To apply for benefits, call the nearest Ontario Disability Support Program office. Applications are also available online, or at your local ODSP office. It can take from a few weeks up to a few months to find out if you qualify for disability benefits. In the meantime, if you need help right away to pay for food, housing and other living costs, you can apply for financial assistance under Ontario Works. If you qualify, Ontario Works will be able to help you right away. They can also help you apply for Ontario Disability Support Program Income Support.

You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump-sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
In 2013, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act became law, providing stronger protections for Ontario consumers.
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. The first is that they must send you a written notice through the mail. This notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
After sending the notice, the agency must wait six days before it can contact you.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
There are a number of restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do. They cannot continue to contact you if:  (1) you send them a registered letter saying that you dispute the debt and suggest the matter be taken to court,  (2) you or your lawyer send them a registered letter providing your lawyer’s contact information and notifying the agency to communicate only with your lawyer, and (3) you are not the person they are looking for and you have told them so.
In addition, a collection agency cannot:

contact you on Sunday, except between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
contact you on any other day of the week between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
contact you on a statutory holiday
use profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person, etc.
tell you false or misleading information
tell you they have started a court action when they have not
add any extra fees or amounts to the money you owe.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency, or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, you may make a complaint to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.

This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else's reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person's reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else's reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person's reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
If you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

Real Estate Law,What are condominiums?,0413,"
				The word ""condominium"" refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of, maintaining a number of facilities in the building called ""common elements."" Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of, maintaining a number of facilities in the building called ""common elements."" Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are legally created once two documents are registered. These are the description and the declaration. The description consists of building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution of the condominium corporation and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against the keeping of pets. In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as the duties and powers of the board of directors of the condominium and the everyday rights and obligations of the residents and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation when the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and are given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium residents pay monthly common expenses. The amount of each resident's common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit, and the types of facilities offered by the condo. For example, condos with swimming pools and entertainment centers will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. These monthly fees can amount to quite a significant cost, so it is important to be aware of them before purchasing a condominium unit.

Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to fully investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, formally called an estoppel certificate, and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
You should pay particular attention to the reserve fund of the condominium corporation and ensure that there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium's major capital items. To do this, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving a status certificate, having five days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"
				Not-for-profit organizations can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,
It exists separate and apart from its shareholders or members,
It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and

It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are (1) not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders, (2) in a not-for-profit corporation, the members are prohibited from receiving any pecuniary gain, and (3) not-for-profit corporations are established for purposes other than gain for their members. The purpose for establishing the corporation is set out in the Articles of Incorporation under the section called 'objects.' A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.
Structure of Ontario not-for-profit corporations
In Ontario, not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest.
As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how the business of the corporation will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the members of the corporation.
Structure of federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, it will also be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a ""certificate of continuance"" to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit company in Canada.

Board of directors
The affairs of a not-for-profit corporation are managed by a board of at least three directors. Directors must be or become members of the corporation, must be at least 18 years of age, and cannot be an undischarged bankrupt. The people named as the first directors in the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of other people appointed or elected in their place. The directors of a not-for-profit corporation are elected by its members. In turn, the directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties and removal of officers of the corporation are governed by its by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, others may be admitted to membership by the directors.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death or resignation of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations or unincorporated associations. However, a not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the objects of the corporation as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.
Auditor and records
To properly and legally run a not-for-profit corporation, an auditor must be appointed by its members every year, and certain records must be kept. These include proper books of account and accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions of the corporation, books containing minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the head office of the corporation and are to be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
More information about forming a not-for-profit in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario Not-for-Profit Guide.

Business Law,Collecting debts,230,"
				Sometimes a business is owed money either by an individual or by another business. The person or business who owes you money is called a debtor and you are called the creditor. If you have trouble getting the money you are owed, there are several steps you should follow.

If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what they owe you. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt, and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or, you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount you are owed is $25,000 or less or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor's assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor's assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means that you can take possession of the asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to make sure that your business does not experience cash flow problems.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are four main advantages to owning a franchise. First, you are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company. Second, you may not have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor. For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice. Third, you enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor's reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product. Fourth, it may be easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.
Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
The Franchise Disclosure Act
Ontario's Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000 or Franchise Disclosure Act is the law that governs all types of franchise relationships. The Act focuses on pre-sale disclosure, and impacts the way in which franchisors carry out the sales of their franchises. Detailed regulations governing the franchisor's behaviour are also a part of the Act, and franchisors must provide prospective frachisees with a 'disclosure document' before accepting any payments from prospective franchisees and before having prospective franchisees sign any agreement related to the franchise.
Franchisors are now required to disclose many important facts, such as the business background of the franchisor and its directors, partners and officers, and the litigation history of the franchisor. The disclosure document must contain copies of all franchise documentation to be signed by a prospective franchisee, including any restriction in the sourcing of supplies.
While the Act is largely about pre-sale disclosure and applies only to franchises sold after January 31, 2001, everyone should be aware of two very important provisions that affect existing franchise relationships:

The Act prohibits a franchisor from interfering with its franchisees' right to associate, and
It provides that ""Every franchise agreement imposes on each party a duty of fair dealing in its performance and enforcement.""

The obligation to deal fairly and conduct oneself in a commercially reasonable manner is an obligation imposed on both the franchisor and the franchisee and applies to all franchise agreements including those made before the Regulations.
There are many complicated legal issues involved with buying and operating franchises. You should consult a lawyer before entering into a franchise agreement.
More information about operating a franchise in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, or the Government of Canada, Canada Business Ontario.

To be eligible for disability benefits, you must complete the application process, which includes medical examinations.
Under the Ontario Disability Support Program, the amount you receive depends on your living arrangement.  It is made up of two portions: Income Support and Employment Support.
Income Support is meant to supplement other income. The basic needs portion of Income Support is meant to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and other necessary personal items. The amount you receive is based on a number of factors, including the number of people in your family and the age of your family members, where you live and how much you pay to live there, and your income and any assets you may have. The shelter allowance portion of the Income Support is meant to help cover such things as: rent or your mortgage payments, heat and utilities;  and is based on your actual shelter costs up to a maximum depending on the number of people in your family. Those who qualify for Income Support may also be eligible for other benefits such as drug and dental coverage, vision care, help with transportation costs, and wheelchair/mobility devise repairs and batteries.
Employment Support is also provided and helps people with disabilities, who can and want to work, prepare for and find a job.
To apply for benefits, call the nearest Ontario Disability Support Program office. Applications are also available online, or at your local ODSP office. It can take from a few weeks up to a few months to find out if you qualify for disability benefits. In the meantime, if you need help right away to pay for food, housing and other living costs, you can apply for financial assistance under Ontario Works. If you qualify, Ontario Works will be able to help you right away. They can also help you apply for Ontario Disability Support Program Income Support.

Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult - posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone's email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion) – sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

How can you prevent cyberbullying?
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims' limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.
 
Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia's Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario's Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it,
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

 
Specifically, Ontario's Education Act states the following:
“bullying” means aggressive and typically repeated behaviour by a pupil where,
(a) the behaviour is intended by the pupil to have the effect of, or the pupil ought to know that the behaviour would be likely to have the effect of,
(i) causing harm, fear or distress to another individual, including physical, psychological, social or academic harm, harm to the individual’s reputation or harm to the individual’s property, or
(ii) creating a negative environment at a school for another individual, and
(b) the behaviour occurs in a context where there is a real or perceived power imbalance between the pupil and the individual based on factors such as size, strength, age, intelligence, peer group power, economic status, social status, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, family circumstances, gender, gender identity, gender expression, race, disability or the receipt of special education; (intimidation)""
 
In addition, the Education Act also provides a definition of cyberbullying:
""For the purposes of the definition of “bullying” in subsection (1), bullying includes bullying by electronic means (commonly known as cyber-bullying), including,
(a) creating a web page or a blog in which the creator assumes the identity of another person;
(b) impersonating another person as the author of content or messages posted on the internet; and
(c) communicating material electronically to more than one individual or posting material on a website that may be accessed by one or more individuals.""
The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP's Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on ""Marriage Contracts,"" the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if the terms of the separation agreement were ordered by a court. If you are concerned that your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the separation agreement, the agreement can be filed with the Family Responsibility Office. By doing this, your agreement can be enforced without cost to you under the Family Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act. This office is funded by the Government of Ontario and has significant powers to enforce support payment under the agreement. You can also file the agreement with the court pursuant to the Family Law Act. For more information on filing your separation agreement, refer to the Family Responsibility Office or visit your local courthouse.
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important and each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements in Ontario, refer to the Ministry of the Attorney General.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information, visit the federal Department of Justice.

There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
 
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Property?,157,"
				A Power of Attorney for Property is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills. The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your Will. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.","

The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your Will. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend. 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The kinds of things that your attorney can do depends entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney for Property that covers all of your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney for Property that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do, and when you are allowing them to do it. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future, or upon a specific occurrence, you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a ""Continuing Power of Attorney for Property"". This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, you should check with a lawyer to determine if it will have effect should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

be 18 years of age or older,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who is 18 years of age or older and mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a trust company to be your attorney for financial matters. Often people choose trust companies because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include, the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.
Drafting a Power of Attorney for Property involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer if you want to make a Power of Attorney for Property.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.

The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

There are four ways to change your name.  First, you can assume your spouse's surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.  Second, you can legally change your surname based on marital status by completing an Election to Change Surname form.

The right to change one's surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
Third, you can change your entire name for any other reason by completing An Application to Change an Adult's Name.  Last, you can apply to change your child's name by completing An Application to Change a Child's Name.  Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
The law governing name changes is the Change of Name Act.  All change of name applications are submitted to the Registrar General's office at:
Office of the Registrar General
PO Box 3000
189 Red River Road
Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5W0
Assuming your spouse's surname upon marriage and resuming your former surname upon divorce or death of spouse
When you get married, you can change your last name by assuming your spouse's last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name). To use this assumed name you do not need to make an application.
By using your government issued marriage certificate, and other government documents to prove your identity, Canadian citizenship and that you are an Ontario resident, you can obtain a new dirver's licence and health card. There is no cost to complete this type of surname change. Once you have a driver's licence with your new assumed surname, you will be able to use your assumed name on your bank accounts and conduct other business under this new name. This type of name change will not change the surname on your birth certificate.
If you get a divorce or annulment, or upon the death of your spouse, you may once again resume using the surname you had immediately prior to your marriage.  Because you assumed your spouse's surname and did not formally change your surname, you do not need to complete a formal application to resume using your previous name. In order to change your surname on government documents, such as a driver's licence, you will need to show your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate) together with documents (such as a birth certificate) showing the name you want to resume using.
 
Legally changing your last name upon marriage:
Election to Change Surname form
Upon marriage, in addition to the right to assume your spouse's surname, you have the right to legally change your last name to your spouse’s last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name) by completing the Election to Change Surname form. Unlike assuming your spouse's surname, this type of name change will appear on your Ontario birth certificate. You may also change your last name while you are living with a person in a conjugal relationship outside marriage. This applies to both opposite sex or same couples.
To legally change your last name upon marriage, you will need to complete the Election to Change Surname form, which applies to both those who are legally married and to those living in a common-law relationship.  There is no fee to submit this type of application provided you do so within 90 days of being married or of filing a joint declaration of conjugal relationship. After 90 days, the fee is $25. This form is only obtainable by calling 1-800-461-2156. In addition to completing this form, you will need to provide:

Your marriage certificate, or if living common-law, a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form
Birth Certificate(s)
Change of Name Certificate(s) (if applicable)
Police records check (if applicable)

After your application is processed you will receive a letter confirming the change.  You will then need to order a new Ontario birth certificate, which will show your new name as well as your previous name.  You will also be able to obtain other Ontario government issued documents, such as a driver's licence and health card, which will show your new surname.
 
Legally change your last name after divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse:
Election to Resume Former Surname form
After a marriage is dissolved by either a divorce, annulment or the death of your spouse, you may resume using the surname you had immediately before marriage.  If you legally changed your last name to that of your spouse by completing the Election to Change Surname form (as opposed to simply assuming your spouse's surname), then you will need to complete the Election to Resume Former Surname form.
In addition to the form, you will need to submit a copy of your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate), your change of name certificate, and your birth certificate, and submit these together with the $25 fee. This form can only be obtained by calling the Registrar General's office at 1-800-461-2156. Once the change has been completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.
It is important to know that the Election to Resume Former Surname application must be submitted within 90 days of the dissolution of your marriage, otherwise, you will be required to file a formal name change using the Application to Change an Adult's Name form, which is a longer application process.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage:
Application to Change an Adult's Name
The Application to Change an Adult's Name is used to change your name for other than martial reasons. With this type of application you can change all of your names, as opposed to only your surname. The fee is $137. This type of name change will change the name on your Ontario birth certificate. The form is available online at ontario.ca
To change your name for a reason other than marriage, you must be:•

16 years of age or older, and
have lived in Ontario for at least one year before submitting the application.

In addition to completing the form, you will be required to submit other documents such as:

if born in Canada, original birth certificate (or certified copy),
copy of marriage certificate (if you are currently married) or a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form (if you are living common-law)
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If you are 16 or 17 years old, and you are married, you can complete this application without the consent of your parents or guardian.  You will, however, need to submit proof of your marriage. If you are 16 or 17 years old and not married, you will need to obtain permission from your parents, guardians or anyone who has legal custody of you before you can change your name.
Once the name change is completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.

Changing a child’s last name
If you want to change the name of a child who is 17 years of age or younger and has lived in Ontario for at least the past 12 months, you must submit an Application to Change a Child's Name.  You must have legal custody of the child, and the child must be unmarried.  As with the adult application, this form can be obtained online at ontario.ca.  The fee to change a child's name is $22 for each child if they change their names at the same time as one of their parents.
In addition to the application form and the fee, you will need to submit other documents, such as:

birth certificate (or certified copy),
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If a child 16 or 17 years old would like to change their name on their own, they can do so if they are married, or if unmarried, as long as they have the written consent of their parents, legal guardian, or anyone who has legal custody of them. In either case, they need to use the Application to Change an Adult's Name and pay the $137 fee.
For more information on changing your name, you can call the Office of the Registrar General in Toronto at 416-325-8305 or toll-free 1-800-461-2156. Or visit ontario.ca.

If you are living in a common-law relationship, you will have a number of rights and obligations arising under family law, tax law, social assistance and family benefits, and employee benefit plans. Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law. First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three continuous years. Second, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living together by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether one person was financially supporting the other person, whether they have had a sexual relationship and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common-law spouse.
Social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for social assistance and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse's income on your application for benefits. Under the social assistance and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for three months, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse's employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under the Ontario Human Rights Code. It is important to note that the Human Rights Code is not applicable to matters between private parties so only government plans that exclude same-sex couples will be subject to constitutional challenges. However, in union situations, if the collective agreement contains specific provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, exclusion of same-sex couples from the employee benefit plan would be a violation of the agreement. You should check with your personnel department for information on your employee benefit plan.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

				Canada's Anti-terrorism Act, 2015 (the Act) received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015.
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
 
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				If parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, the other parent is usually responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of eighteen. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent's rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of 18 if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a ""father"" for the purposes of paying child support.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government  family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments and is based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the Ontario or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Ontario Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Ontario, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

As mentioned, the type of parenting arrangement, for example whether there is split, sole or joint custody, also affects the amount of child support paid.
The rules determining income can be complex but usually are calculated on a spouse's total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use these guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997 is neither deducted from the payer's income nor added to the recipient's income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997 these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don't want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement, for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.
More information is also available from the federal Department of Justice.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as 'offer and acceptance'. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.

Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.

When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation - a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake - where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence - when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity - those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.

Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.

 
How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, in Ontario, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in the Consumer Protection Act and the Sale of Goods Act. In an attempt to protect consumers, these Acts set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, the Employment Standards Act applies. The provisions of the Act contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected. See topic 240 Employment contracts in this section of Legal Line for more information.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.
For more information about the responsibilities of a business under the Ontario Consumer Protection Act, refer to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements.

				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult - posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone's email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion) – sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

How can you prevent cyberbullying?
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims' limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.
 
Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia's Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario's Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it,
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

 
Specifically, Ontario's Education Act states the following:
“bullying” means aggressive and typically repeated behaviour by a pupil where,
(a) the behaviour is intended by the pupil to have the effect of, or the pupil ought to know that the behaviour would be likely to have the effect of,
(i) causing harm, fear or distress to another individual, including physical, psychological, social or academic harm, harm to the individual’s reputation or harm to the individual’s property, or
(ii) creating a negative environment at a school for another individual, and
(b) the behaviour occurs in a context where there is a real or perceived power imbalance between the pupil and the individual based on factors such as size, strength, age, intelligence, peer group power, economic status, social status, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, family circumstances, gender, gender identity, gender expression, race, disability or the receipt of special education; (intimidation)""
 
In addition, the Education Act also provides a definition of cyberbullying:
""For the purposes of the definition of “bullying” in subsection (1), bullying includes bullying by electronic means (commonly known as cyber-bullying), including,
(a) creating a web page or a blog in which the creator assumes the identity of another person;
(b) impersonating another person as the author of content or messages posted on the internet; and
(c) communicating material electronically to more than one individual or posting material on a website that may be accessed by one or more individuals.""
The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP's Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what they owe you. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt, and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or, you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount you are owed is $25,000 or less or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor's assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor's assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means that you can take possession of the asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to make sure that your business does not experience cash flow problems.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations
Public foundations
Private foundations

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public's perspective.
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.

The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person's reputation.

Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts' willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go ""forum shopping"". Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet's broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet's potential audience without proper proof.

In 2013, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act became law, providing stronger protections for Ontario consumers.
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. The first is that they must send you a written notice through the mail. This notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
After sending the notice, the agency must wait six days before it can contact you.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
There are a number of restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do. They cannot continue to contact you if:  (1) you send them a registered letter saying that you dispute the debt and suggest the matter be taken to court,  (2) you or your lawyer send them a registered letter providing your lawyer’s contact information and notifying the agency to communicate only with your lawyer, and (3) you are not the person they are looking for and you have told them so.
In addition, a collection agency cannot:

contact you on Sunday, except between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
contact you on any other day of the week between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
contact you on a statutory holiday
use profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person, etc.
tell you false or misleading information
tell you they have started a court action when they have not
add any extra fees or amounts to the money you owe.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency, or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, you may make a complaint to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.

The customer then owes the business a debt. Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means that the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt. Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the Ontario Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
A Writ of Execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver's Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

1.  Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can take security on the debtor's assets, usually the one you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor. A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral. To conduct this search, you can use the Access Now online service provided by the Ontario Government. In addition, you will also be able to register a personal property lien using the Access Now service.
There is a small fee for each name or vehicle identification number searched.
2.  Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus in Ontario: Equifax and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3.  Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you may search the Ministry of Attorney General database. Local searches of the Writs System can be performed at any enforcement office of the Ministry by its staff, but only with respect to writs of execution filed in the local jurisdiction. Teranet offers enhanced services at any Land Registry Office (LRO) through Teranet’s ROSCO terminals or remotely through Teraview for writ searches across all sheriff/enforcement office jurisdictions. End users can also access services through Teranet’s Teranet eXpress website to perform searches of the Writs System by enforcement office or across the province and can issue and file Writs of Execution electronically. For more information, visit Teranet.
You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a fee. There are also commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4.  Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5.  Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
To search for information on an Ontario corporation, you must complete a Government of Ontario, Corporation Profile Report. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6.  Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7.  Search at Official Receiver's office
Next, a search at the Official Receiver's office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether they have filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				
What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
""(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.""
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
""(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.""
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.
Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.
Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.
 
What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.

 
Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.
Visit Canada's Department of Justice for more information about criminal law and the justice system in Canada, or, view the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to see information regarding specific drug related offences.

In Canada, there are four ""heads"" or categories of charities. They are:

The relief of poverty.

The advancement of religion.
Other purposes beneficial to the community.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations
Public foundations
Private foundations

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public's perspective.
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario guide on charitable status.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Child support,117,"
				If parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, the other parent is usually responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by ","
				If parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, the other parent is usually responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of eighteen. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent's rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of 18 if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a ""father"" for the purposes of paying child support.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government  family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments and is based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the Ontario or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Ontario Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Ontario, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

As mentioned, the type of parenting arrangement, for example whether there is split, sole or joint custody, also affects the amount of child support paid.
The rules determining income can be complex but usually are calculated on a spouse's total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use these guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997 is neither deducted from the payer's income nor added to the recipient's income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997 these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don't want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement, for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.
More information is also available from the federal Department of Justice.

				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means that the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.

The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means that the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt. Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the Ontario Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
A Writ of Execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver's Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

1.  Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can take security on the debtor's assets, usually the one you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor. A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral. To conduct this search, you can use the Access Now online service provided by the Ontario Government. In addition, you will also be able to register a personal property lien using the Access Now service.
There is a small fee for each name or vehicle identification number searched.
2.  Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus in Ontario: Equifax and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3.  Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you may search the Ministry of Attorney General database. Local searches of the Writs System can be performed at any enforcement office of the Ministry by its staff, but only with respect to writs of execution filed in the local jurisdiction. Teranet offers enhanced services at any Land Registry Office (LRO) through Teranet’s ROSCO terminals or remotely through Teraview for writ searches across all sheriff/enforcement office jurisdictions. End users can also access services through Teranet’s Teranet eXpress website to perform searches of the Writs System by enforcement office or across the province and can issue and file Writs of Execution electronically. For more information, visit Teranet.
You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a fee. There are also commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4.  Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5.  Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
To search for information on an Ontario corporation, you must complete a Government of Ontario, Corporation Profile Report. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6.  Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7.  Search at Official Receiver's office
Next, a search at the Official Receiver's office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether they have filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8.  Vehicle record and driver record search
Finally, Vehicle Record or Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, you must complete specific forms that are available at the Ministry of Transportation. There is a small fee for each search conducted.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what they owe you. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt, and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or, you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount you are owed is $25,000 or less or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor's assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor's assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means that you can take possession of the asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to make sure that your business does not experience cash flow problems.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Defamation: Libel and slander,480,"
				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else's reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person's reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else's reputation.

Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
If you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.

In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit them from owning a dog for a certain time.
Ontario also specifically bans ""pit bulls"" from being bred, imported or transferred through the province. Pit bulls in the province before 2005 are exempted. That said, a ""restricted pit bull"" must be muzzled, leashed and sterilized. An offence can result in a fine of up to $10,000 and/or six months in jail.

To be eligible for disability benefits, you must complete the application process, which includes medical examinations.
Under the Ontario Disability Support Program, the amount you receive depends on your living arrangement.  It is made up of two portions: Income Support and Employment Support.
Income Support is meant to supplement other income. The basic needs portion of Income Support is meant to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and other necessary personal items. The amount you receive is based on a number of factors, including the number of people in your family and the age of your family members, where you live and how much you pay to live there, and your income and any assets you may have. The shelter allowance portion of the Income Support is meant to help cover such things as: rent or your mortgage payments, heat and utilities;  and is based on your actual shelter costs up to a maximum depending on the number of people in your family. Those who qualify for Income Support may also be eligible for other benefits such as drug and dental coverage, vision care, help with transportation costs, and wheelchair/mobility devise repairs and batteries.
Employment Support is also provided and helps people with disabilities, who can and want to work, prepare for and find a job.

Criminal Law,What is a criminal record?,793,"
				Not all dealings with the police result in a criminal record. For example, if the police give you a parking ticket, this is an offence under a municipal by-law and is not considered criminal.

Having said that however, for practical purposes, any record held at a government office, containing information about a person's criminal activity or involvement is considered to be a type of criminal record. This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.
For more information about removing a criminal record, call the Pardons Canada telephone support line, toll-free at 1-877-929-6011 or in Toronto at 416-929-6011, or visit their website at pardons.org.

Real Estate Law,What are condominiums?,0413,"
				The word ""condominium"" refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

				The word ""condominium"" refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of, maintaining a number of facilities in the building called ""common elements."" Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are legally created once two documents are registered. These are the description and the declaration. The description consists of building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution of the condominium corporation and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against the keeping of pets. In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as the duties and powers of the board of directors of the condominium and the everyday rights and obligations of the residents and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation when the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and are given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium residents pay monthly common expenses. The amount of each resident's common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit, and the types of facilities offered by the condo. For example, condos with swimming pools and entertainment centers will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. These monthly fees can amount to quite a significant cost, so it is important to be aware of them before purchasing a condominium unit.

Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to fully investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, formally called an estoppel certificate, and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
You should pay particular attention to the reserve fund of the condominium corporation and ensure that there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium's major capital items. To do this, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving a status certificate, having five days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.
To review your provincial legislation and for more information about condominiums, visit our Links section. Additional information can also be obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Government and Consumer Services - Consumer Protection When Buying a Condo, and from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's Condominium Buyer's Guide.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or 'certified' by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant's costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump-sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
In 2013, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act became law, providing stronger protections for Ontario consumers.
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. The first is that they must send you a written notice through the mail. This notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
After sending the notice, the agency must wait six days before it can contact you.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
There are a number of restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do. They cannot continue to contact you if:  (1) you send them a registered letter saying that you dispute the debt and suggest the matter be taken to court,  (2) you or your lawyer send them a registered letter providing your lawyer’s contact information and notifying the agency to communicate only with your lawyer, and (3) you are not the person they are looking for and you have told them so.
In addition, a collection agency cannot:

contact you on Sunday, except between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
contact you on any other day of the week between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
contact you on a statutory holiday
use profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person, etc.
tell you false or misleading information
tell you they have started a court action when they have not
add any extra fees or amounts to the money you owe.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency, or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, you may make a complaint to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.

Employment Law,Employment contracts,600,"
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee's salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed.
In Ontario, the relationship is governed by several statutes, including the Employment Standards Act, the Labour Relations Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. These statutes establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee's minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affec","
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee's salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed.
In Ontario, the relationship is governed by several statutes, including the Employment Standards Act, the Labour Relations Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. These statutes establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee's minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee's duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer's promise of a job and the employee's promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract's duration, and
a description of the employee's duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee's rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee's job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee's position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For legal advice about employment contract matters, consult a lawyer.

Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law. First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three continuous years. Second, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living together by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether one person was financially supporting the other person, whether they have had a sexual relationship and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common-law spouse.
Social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for social assistance and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse's income on your application for benefits. Under the social assistance and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for three months, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse's employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under the Ontario Human Rights Code. It is important to note that the Human Rights Code is not applicable to matters between private parties so only government plans that exclude same-sex couples will be subject to constitutional challenges. However, in union situations, if the collective agreement contains specific provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, exclusion of same-sex couples from the employee benefit plan would be a violation of the agreement. You should check with your personnel department for information on your employee benefit plan.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under the Ontario Business Corporations Act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
 
Steps to dissolve a corporation
Although a corporation incorporated in Ontario may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all Ontario tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services will deny the application for dissolution.
In order to dissolve an Ontario corporation, an application first must be made to the Ministry of Finance requesting its consent. The corporation must send a letter to the Ministry of Finance, Client Services Branch requesting them to provide a Letter of Consent to Dissolve Corporation. In the request, you must include the full corporate name, the Ontario incorporation number, and the federal Business Number. The request must be signed by an authorized director of the corporation.
Once the corporation receives the Consent to Dissolve from the Ministry of Finance, the corporation has 60 days to make its application for dissolution to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. The request for dissolution is mailed to the Companies and Personal Property Security Branch, 393 University Avenue, Suite 200, Toronto ON M5G 2M2. It must include:

The Letter of Consent to Dissolve Corporation.
Two sets of Articles of Dissolution with original signatures (blank articles available online).
A government fee made payable to the Minister of Finance.
If desired, you can also include the ServiceOntario Acknowledgement we have Received your Application Form, which allows you to provide the Ministry with an email address in order for them to confirm receipt of your request (this form is available online).
A covering letter providing a contact name, return address and telephone number.

If you wish to submit the application in person, you can do so at the Companies and Personal Property Security Branch office at 375 University Avenue, 2nd Floor, Toronto ON. It is advisable that you keep a copy of the documents you are submitting, and that you obtain a receipt, or a stamp from the Ministry, that shows they received your application.
Once your request is approved, the Ministry will mail you a copy of the Articles of Dissolution certified with their stamp and the date of the dissolution. The corporation is legally dissolved from the date of the certification.
For information on closing your business, visit ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's Canada Business Ontario. For information on dissolving a business incorporated under the federal Canada Business Corporations Act, visit Corporations Canada.

In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit them from owning a dog for a certain time.
Ontario also specifically bans ""pit bulls"" from being bred, imported or transferred through the province. Pit bulls in the province before 2005 are exempted. That said, a ""restricted pit bull"" must be muzzled, leashed and sterilized. An offence can result in a fine of up to $10,000 and/or six months in jail.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are four main advantages to owning a franchise. First, you are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company. Second, you may not have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor. For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice. Third, you enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor's reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product. Fourth, it may be easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.
Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
The Franchise Disclosure Act
Ontario's Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000 or Franchise Disclosure Act is the law that governs all types of franchise relationships. The Act focuses on pre-sale disclosure, and impacts the way in which franchisors carry out the sales of their franchises. Detailed regulations governing the franchisor's behaviour are also a part of the Act, and franchisors must provide prospective frachisees with a 'disclosure document' before accepting any payments from prospective franchisees and before having prospective franchisees sign any agreement related to the franchise.
Franchisors are now required to disclose many important facts, such as the business background of the franchisor and its directors, partners and officers, and the litigation history of the franchisor. The disclosure document must contain copies of all franchise documentation to be signed by a prospective franchisee, including any restriction in the sourcing of supplies.
While the Act is largely about pre-sale disclosure and applies only to franchises sold after January 31, 2001, everyone should be aware of two very important provisions that affect existing franchise relationships:

The Act prohibits a franchisor from interfering with its franchisees' right to associate, and
It provides that ""Every franchise agreement imposes on each party a duty of fair dealing in its performance and enforcement.""

The obligation to deal fairly and conduct oneself in a commercially reasonable manner is an obligation imposed on both the franchisor and the franchisee and applies to all franchise agreements including those made before the Regulations.
There are many complicated legal issues involved with buying and operating franchises. You should consult a lawyer before entering into a franchise agreement.
More information about operating a franchise in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, or the Government of Canada, Canada Business Ontario.

However, some information is not readily available without requesting it, such as government salaries, internal memos, expenses, and reports on sensitive subject matters.
In Ontario, there are three main laws that regulate requests for information held by a government office:

Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (MFIPPA)
Provincial: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
Federal: Access to Information Act

Provincial and municipal information
Informal request
To request information from a provincial or municipal office, you can first make an informal request by calling, writing or visiting the government office from which you want to collect the information. An online Directory of Records for provincial government organizations is available on the Ontario Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) website. Municipal government offices have their own directories available in a number of places, including city halls, police departments and boards of education.
Formal request
If you are not able obtain the information you are looking for this way, you may submit a formal freedom of information request. To make a formal request, you must complete a request for information form. Request forms are available at most government offices. A generic request form is available online from the IPC website. You must then submit the request, along with a small fee, to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Coordinator at the government office from which you want to collect the information.
When making a request, both formal and informal, you must state the law under which the request is being made: the Provincial FIPPA, or the Municipal MFIPPA.
The Coordinator has 30 days to respond to your request.
Appeals to IPC
If your request is denied, you can appeal to the IPC by filling out forms available at the IPC office. Appeals must be made within 30 days of the government's decision. For more information, contact the Ontario Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner.
 
Federal information
For federal offices, you also have the option of making an informal request or a formal request. These requests are made pursuant to the Access to Information Act.
Informal request
To make an informal request for information, call the office you want information from and ask who in the office you should make the request to. Write a letter to this person requesting the information. If your informal request is denied, you make make a formal request.
Formal request
To make a formal request, you are required to fill out an Access to Information Request Form. A generic Access to Information Request form, which can be used for most federal offices, is available online from the Government of Canada website. There is no fee. Submit the request to the Access to Information Coordinator assigned to the federal office or agency you want information from.
Complaints
If your request is denied, or if you have a complaint about the procedure, you can speak with someone at the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada (OIC) to discuss your options. If you would like to make a complaint, you may do so for reasons, such as:

you believe you were improperly denied access to the information requested;
the request process is taking too long;
the request fees are too high;
you did not receive the information in your official language of choice; or
for other reasonable grounds.

Except in the case where your request is taking too long, you must submit your complaint to the OIC within 60 days of receiving your answer from the relevant federal institution.
The OIC will assign an Investigator to your case. The Investigator will give you an opportunity to present your complaint and will also obtain information from the federal institution in question. In many cases, the OIC Investigator will attempt to settle the complain by mediation, unless the Investigator decides the institution acted properly. The OIC will report its decision to you.
Appeals
Regardless of whether the OIC agrees with your complaint, you have the right to take your case to the Federal Court of Canada for a review of the federal institution's original decision.
In addition, the Commissioner may also decide to take a case to the Federal Court if it involves an important point of law. In such cases, the OIC must first receive your approval to do so.

Internet and Cyber Law,"Is ""spam"" email legal? CASL - Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation",345,"
				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are four main advantages to owning a franchise. First, you are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company. Second, you may not have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor. For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice. Third, you enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor's reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product. Fourth, it may be easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.
Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
The Franchise Disclosure Act
Ontario's Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000 or Franchise Disclosure Act is the law that governs all types of franchise relationships. The Act focuses on pre-sale disclosure, and impacts the way in which franchisors carry out the sales of their franchises. Detailed regulations governing the franchisor's behaviour are also a part of the Act, and franchisors must provide prospective frachisees with a 'disclosure document' before accepting any payments from prospective franchisees and before having prospective franchisees sign any agreement related to the franchise.
Franchisors are now required to disclose many important facts, such as the business background of the franchisor and its directors, partners and officers, and the litigation history of the franchisor. The disclosure document must contain copies of all franchise documentation to be signed by a prospective franchisee, including any restriction in the sourcing of supplies.
While the Act is largely about pre-sale disclosure and applies only to franchises sold after January 31, 2001, everyone should be aware of two very important provisions that affect existing franchise relationships:

The Act prohibits a franchisor from interfering with its franchisees' right to associate, and
It provides that ""Every franchise agreement imposes on each party a duty of fair dealing in its performance and enforcement.""

The obligation to deal fairly and conduct oneself in a commercially reasonable manner is an obligation imposed on both the franchisor and the franchisee and applies to all franchise agreements including those made before the Regulations.
There are many complicated legal issues involved with buying and operating franchises. You should consult a lawyer before entering into a franchise agreement.
More information about operating a franchise in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, or the Government of Canada, Canada Business Ontario.

				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.
 
Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
 
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada's Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, refer to Canada Border Services Agency.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Ontario Business Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
Additional information can also be found from Canada Business Ontario.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and Employment Insurance contributions from the employees' paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer's legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website. More information is also available from the Ministry of Labour.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
Special considerations for home businesses
1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence.
In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public's perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person's home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements. You can also visit ServiceOntario for more information about provincial licensing requirements.
Visit ontario.ca for a listing of Ontario Small Business Enterprise Centre locations where you can go for help to start and grow your business. More information about starting and operating a business in Ontario can also be found from the Government of Canada, Canada Business Ontario.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues which arise with a home business can be very complicated and have some unique requirements, it is advisable to consult a lawyer for advice and assistance.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother i","
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, under the Children's Law Reform Act, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child's father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the Family Law Act imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The Act provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16 years of age or older if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by the Child Support Guidelines of Ontario and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights under the Children's Law Reform Act.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
 
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada's Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, refer to Canada Border Services Agency.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Ontario Business Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
Additional information can also be found from Canada Business Ontario.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

In other situations, you must use a lawyer.  Every lawyer and paralegal practising in Ontario must be a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada. Lawyers and paralegals who provide legal services to the public are required to carry professional liability insurance.
In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that ""signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine"". In Ontario, notaries public are governed by the Notaries Act.  A lawyer can be a notary public, but not every notary public is a lawyer.  Also, notaries public do not have to undergo special education or training.  A notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B), a Juris Doctor (JD) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society.  In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer) or, a Law Practice Program (a combination of training and work placement).
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

Paralegals
Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Paralegals must complete a legal services program approved by the Law Society as well as licensing examinations. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and minor, limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or Wills and estates. For a more complete description of what a paralegal can do, refer to topic 857 Do you need a lawyer or paralegal?
Typically, paralegals' fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers' fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits.  An affidavit is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true.  A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other oaths, affirmations or declarations inside or outside of Ontario, or subject to any limit placed upon them by the Attorney General.
In Ontario, individuals who are not lawyers who wish to become a notary public or commissioner for taking oaths, may do so by completing an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. Applicants will only be considered if their employment requires the notarizing of documents in Ontario for:

Senior government officials
Ontario registered corporations engaged in international or inter-provincial trade and/or commerce
Patent and trademark agents
Head offices of national or provincial unions engaged in out-of-province business.

Visit the Ministry of the Attorney General for more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits.
Contact the Law Society of Upper Canada if you wish to confirm that an Ontario lawyer or licensed paralegal is entitled to provide legal services. This will help you make an informed decision on whether the person you are thinking of hiring is right for you.

It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are (1) not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders, (2) in a not-for-profit corporation, the members are prohibited from receiving any pecuniary gain, and (3) not-for-profit corporations are established for purposes other than gain for their members. The purpose for establishing the corporation is set out in the Articles of Incorporation under the section called 'objects.' A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.
Structure of Ontario not-for-profit corporations
In Ontario, not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest.
As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how the business of the corporation will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the members of the corporation.
Structure of federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, it will also be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a ""certificate of continuance"" to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit company in Canada.

Board of directors
The affairs of a not-for-profit corporation are managed by a board of at least three directors. Directors must be or become members of the corporation, must be at least 18 years of age, and cannot be an undischarged bankrupt. The people named as the first directors in the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of other people appointed or elected in their place. The directors of a not-for-profit corporation are elected by its members. In turn, the directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties and removal of officers of the corporation are governed by its by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, others may be admitted to membership by the directors.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death or resignation of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations or unincorporated associations. However, a not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the objects of the corporation as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.
Auditor and records
To properly and legally run a not-for-profit corporation, an auditor must be appointed by its members every year, and certain records must be kept. These include proper books of account and accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions of the corporation, books containing minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the head office of the corporation and are to be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
More information about forming a not-for-profit in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario Not-for-Profit Guide.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				The Ontario government has established a number of rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.

Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Birth parents must register the birth of their child within 30 days of the birth, giving the child a legal identity and ensuring that the child will get certain documents, such as a birth certificate and a passport. The child must be at least seven days old before written permission for adoption can be given and the natural parents then have 21 days to change their mind and cancel the permission. If permission is cancelled within the 21 days, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the 21 days has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their mind about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents' consent.
 
How to adopt a child in Ontario
There are generally two ways to adopt a child in Ontario. The first is a public adoption through the Children's Aid Society. The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licenced by the Ontario Government.
To adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved the Society will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the adoption order is given by the court. There is no cost for parents to adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society public adoption process.
The process to adopt a child through a private agency is very similar to that of adopting a child through the Children's Aid Society. For a private adoption, you must contact a private adoption practitioner that has been approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. In addition, you will be charged a fee for the private services, which is generally between $15,000 and $25,000.
 
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, you do not need to go through the Children's Aid Society or a private adoption agency. However, you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order. An assessment by an adoption practitioner is not needed for this type of adoption, unless the judge requires it.
However, if you wish to adopt a family member who lives outside Canada, there are a number of steps you must take, including:

complete a homestudy assessment and training program,
be approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services,
apply through an Ontario agency licensed to handle adoptions in the child's home country, and
submit an application to Canadian immigration to get permission for your adopted child to move to Canada.

 
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 - Adopting a child from abroad.
 
The approval process for all adoptions
Ontario residents are required to complete two programs as part of the approval process for either a private, public or international adoption:
1) The Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) homestudy is completed by licensed social workers approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services before approving the arrangements for the adoption. The purpose of homestudy is to assess the ability of the applicants to parent an adopted child, and involves discussions with an adoption worker about the adoptive parents attitudes towards parenting as well as exploring their values and beliefs. It can include references, medical reports and other personal information.
2) The Parent Resources for Information and Development and Education (PRIDE) program is a standardized training program to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child. The curriculum involves a variety of areas such as: the importance of connections to the child's birth family and kin, and the importance of cultural and racial awareness.
For more information about adopting a child in Ontario, contact the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For legal advice and assistance, contact a lawyer.

There are four ways to change your name.  First, you can assume your spouse's surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.  Second, you can legally change your surname based on marital status by completing an Election to Change Surname form. The right to change one's surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.

The right to change one's surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
Third, you can change your entire name for any other reason by completing An Application to Change an Adult's Name.  Last, you can apply to change your child's name by completing An Application to Change a Child's Name.  Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
The law governing name changes is the Change of Name Act.  All change of name applications are submitted to the Registrar General's office at:
Office of the Registrar General
PO Box 3000
189 Red River Road
Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5W0
Assuming your spouse's surname upon marriage and resuming your former surname upon divorce or death of spouse
When you get married, you can change your last name by assuming your spouse's last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name). To use this assumed name you do not need to make an application.
By using your government issued marriage certificate, and other government documents to prove your identity, Canadian citizenship and that you are an Ontario resident, you can obtain a new dirver's licence and health card. There is no cost to complete this type of surname change. Once you have a driver's licence with your new assumed surname, you will be able to use your assumed name on your bank accounts and conduct other business under this new name. This type of name change will not change the surname on your birth certificate.
If you get a divorce or annulment, or upon the death of your spouse, you may once again resume using the surname you had immediately prior to your marriage.  Because you assumed your spouse's surname and did not formally change your surname, you do not need to complete a formal application to resume using your previous name. In order to change your surname on government documents, such as a driver's licence, you will need to show your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate) together with documents (such as a birth certificate) showing the name you want to resume using.
 
Legally changing your last name upon marriage:
Election to Change Surname form
Upon marriage, in addition to the right to assume your spouse's surname, you have the right to legally change your last name to your spouse’s last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name) by completing the Election to Change Surname form. Unlike assuming your spouse's surname, this type of name change will appear on your Ontario birth certificate. You may also change your last name while you are living with a person in a conjugal relationship outside marriage. This applies to both opposite sex or same couples.
To legally change your last name upon marriage, you will need to complete the Election to Change Surname form, which applies to both those who are legally married and to those living in a common-law relationship.  There is no fee to submit this type of application provided you do so within 90 days of being married or of filing a joint declaration of conjugal relationship. After 90 days, the fee is $25. This form is only obtainable by calling 1-800-461-2156. In addition to completing this form, you will need to provide:

Your marriage certificate, or if living common-law, a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form
Birth Certificate(s)
Change of Name Certificate(s) (if applicable)
Police records check (if applicable)

After your application is processed you will receive a letter confirming the change.  You will then need to order a new Ontario birth certificate, which will show your new name as well as your previous name.  You will also be able to obtain other Ontario government issued documents, such as a driver's licence and health card, which will show your new surname.
 
Legally change your last name after divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse:
Election to Resume Former Surname form
After a marriage is dissolved by either a divorce, annulment or the death of your spouse, you may resume using the surname you had immediately before marriage.  If you legally changed your last name to that of your spouse by completing the Election to Change Surname form (as opposed to simply assuming your spouse's surname), then you will need to complete the Election to Resume Former Surname form.
In addition to the form, you will need to submit a copy of your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate), your change of name certificate, and your birth certificate, and submit these together with the $25 fee. This form can only be obtained by calling the Registrar General's office at 1-800-461-2156. Once the change has been completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.
It is important to know that the Election to Resume Former Surname application must be submitted within 90 days of the dissolution of your marriage, otherwise, you will be required to file a formal name change using the Application to Change an Adult's Name form, which is a longer application process.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage:
Application to Change an Adult's Name
The Application to Change an Adult's Name is used to change your name for other than martial reasons. With this type of application you can change all of your names, as opposed to only your surname. The fee is $137. This type of name change will change the name on your Ontario birth certificate. The form is available online at ontario.ca
To change your name for a reason other than marriage, you must be:•

16 years of age or older, and
have lived in Ontario for at least one year before submitting the application.

In addition to completing the form, you will be required to submit other documents such as:

if born in Canada, original birth certificate (or certified copy),
copy of marriage certificate (if you are currently married) or a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form (if you are living common-law)
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If you are 16 or 17 years old, and you are married, you can complete this application without the consent of your parents or guardian.  You will, however, need to submit proof of your marriage. If you are 16 or 17 years old and not married, you will need to obtain permission from your parents, guardians or anyone who has legal custody of you before you can change your name.
Once the name change is completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.

Changing a child’s last name
If you want to change the name of a child who is 17 years of age or younger and has lived in Ontario for at least the past 12 months, you must submit an Application to Change a Child's Name.  You must have legal custody of the child, and the child must be unmarried.  As with the adult application, this form can be obtained online at ontario.ca.  The fee to change a child's name is $22 for each child if they change their names at the same time as one of their parents.
In addition to the application form and the fee, you will need to submit other documents, such as:

birth certificate (or certified copy),
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If a child 16 or 17 years old would like to change their name on their own, they can do so if they are married, or if unmarried, as long as they have the written consent of their parents, legal guardian, or anyone who has legal custody of them. In either case, they need to use the Application to Change an Adult's Name and pay the $137 fee.
For more information on changing your name, you can call the Office of the Registrar General in Toronto at 416-325-8305 or toll-free 1-800-461-2156. Or visit ontario.ca.

				Canada's Anti-terrorism Act, 2015 (the Act) received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015.
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
 
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smell of alcohol. Under the law, the police have the right to stop your car and ask you if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with the police. You are required to provide the police with your driver's licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police also have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin, and following their finger with your eyes. Again, you are not required to co-operate with the police. However, failing to comply may lead the police to suspect that you are impaired, and they may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
In Ontario, if you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver's licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an Ignition interlock Program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver's seat, and is connected to the engine's ignition system.
In Ontario, drivers will be subject to the Ignition Interlock Program if they are:

convicted of an impaired driving or drinking and driving-related offence under the Criminal Code of Canada
suspended for registering a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05 to 0.08 three or more times in a five-year period.

First-time offenders will have an ignition interlock condition placed on their Ontario driver's licence for a minimum of 1 year, while second-time offenders will have the condition for a minimum of 3 years. Third-time offenders will have the condition on their licence indefinitely if it is reinstated after a minimum 10-year suspension. The program does not apply to fourth-time offenders, as their licence will never be reinstated.
For more information on the Ignition Interlock Program, visit the Ontario Ministry of Transportation website.
If you were at fault for an automobile accident while you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Personal care can include decisions about many things, such as health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, but is usually included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will nor does it form part of a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
Is a Living Will enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Whether a Living Will is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
For more information about Living Wills, visit the Ministry of the Attorney General website at attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care, you should consult with a lawyer about making both a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will.

In 2013, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act became law, providing stronger protections for Ontario consumers.
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. The first is that they must send you a written notice through the mail. This notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
After sending the notice, the agency must wait six days before it can contact you.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
There are a number of restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do. They cannot continue to contact you if:  (1) you send them a registered letter saying that you dispute the debt and suggest the matter be taken to court,  (2) you or your lawyer send them a registered letter providing your lawyer’s contact information and notifying the agency to communicate only with your lawyer, and (3) you are not the person they are looking for and you have told them so.
In addition, a collection agency cannot:

contact you on Sunday, except between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
contact you on any other day of the week between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
contact you on a statutory holiday
use profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person, etc.
tell you false or misleading information
tell you they have started a court action when they have not

If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practices, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service you required and the type of professional who provided it.

All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, medical practitioners have an obligation, before administering any kind of medical treatment, to advise the patient fully of any associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has is based on the law, and the guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing full medical history to your doctor, or telling the truth about your case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible, and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out of pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for your pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession. For example, if your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. If your complaint is against an engineer, you may contact Professional Engineers Ontario.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"
				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as 'offer and acceptance'. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.

Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.

When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation - a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake - where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence - when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity - those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.

Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.

 
How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, in Ontario, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in the Consumer Protection Act and the Sale of Goods Act. In an attempt to protect consumers, these Acts set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, the Employment Standards Act applies. The provisions of the Act contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected. See topic 240 Employment contracts in this section of Legal Line for more information.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.
For more information about the responsibilities of a business under the Ontario Consumer Protection Act, refer to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

Types of charities
In Canada, there are four ""heads"" or categories of charities. They are:

The relief of poverty.
The advancement of education.
The advancement of religion.
Other purposes beneficial to the community.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations
Public foundations
Private foundations

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public's perspective.
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario guide on charitable status.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

They may be formally notified of the lawsuit by mail, or they may just read about it in the newspaper.
Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or 'certified' by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant's costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

Family Law,Common-law relationships,121,"

If you are living in a common-law relationship, you will have a number of rights and obligations arising under family law, tax law, social assistance and family benefits, and employee benefit plans.

				When two people live together in a conjugal relationship and they are not married, they may be considered to be living in a ""common-law"" relationship. If you are living in a common-law relationship, you will have a number of rights and obligations arising under family law, tax law, social assistance and family benefits, and employee benefit plans. Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law. First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three continuous years. Second, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living together by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether one person was financially supporting the other person, whether they have had a sexual relationship and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common-law spouse.
Social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for social assistance and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse's income on your application for benefits. Under the social assistance and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for three months, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse's employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under the Ontario Human Rights Code. It is important to note that the Human Rights Code is not applicable to matters between private parties so only government plans that exclude same-sex couples will be subject to constitutional challenges. However, in union situations, if the collective agreement contains specific provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, exclusion of same-sex couples from the employee benefit plan would be a violation of the agreement. You should check with your personnel department for information on your employee benefit plan.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what they owe you. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt, and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or, you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount you are owed is $25,000 or less or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor's assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor's assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means that you can take possession of the asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to make sure that your business does not experience cash flow problems.

The customer then owes the business a debt.

The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means that the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt. Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the Ontario Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
A Writ of Execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver's Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

1.  Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can take security on the debtor's assets, usually the one you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor. A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral. To conduct this search, you can use the Access Now online service provided by the Ontario Government. In addition, you will also be able to register a personal property lien using the Access Now service.
There is a small fee for each name or vehicle identification number searched.
2.  Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus in Ontario: Equifax and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3.  Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you may search the Ministry of Attorney General database. Local searches of the Writs System can be performed at any enforcement office of the Ministry by its staff, but only with respect to writs of execution filed in the local jurisdiction. Teranet offers enhanced services at any Land Registry Office (LRO) through Teranet’s ROSCO terminals or remotely through Teraview for writ searches across all sheriff/enforcement office jurisdictions. End users can also access services through Teranet’s Teranet eXpress website to perform searches of the Writs System by enforcement office or across the province and can issue and file Writs of Execution electronically. For more information, visit Teranet.
You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a fee. There are also commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4.  Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5.  Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
To search for information on an Ontario corporation, you must complete a Government of Ontario, Corporation Profile Report. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6.  Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7.  Search at Official Receiver's office
Next, a search at the Official Receiver's office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether they have filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8.  Vehicle record and driver record search
Finally, Vehicle Record or Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, you must complete specific forms that are available at the Ministry of Transportation. There is a small fee for each search conducted.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of eighteen. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent's rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of 18 if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a ""father"" for the purposes of paying child support.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government  family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments and is based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the Ontario or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Ontario Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Ontario, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

As mentioned, the type of parenting arrangement, for example whether there is split, sole or joint custody, also affects the amount of child support paid.
The rules determining income can be complex but usually are calculated on a spouse's total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use these guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997 is neither deducted from the payer's income nor added to the recipient's income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997 these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don't want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement, for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.

Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of eighteen. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent's rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of 18 if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or 'certified' by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant's costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under the Ontario Business Corporations Act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
 
Steps to dissolve a corporation
Although a corporation incorporated in Ontario may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all Ontario tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services will deny the application for dissolution.
In order to dissolve an Ontario corporation, an application first must be made to the Ministry of Finance requesting its consent. The corporation must send a letter to the Ministry of Finance, Client Services Branch requesting them to provide a Letter of Consent to Dissolve Corporation. In the request, you must include the full corporate name, the Ontario incorporation number, and the federal Business Number. The request must be signed by an authorized director of the corporation.
Once the corporation receives the Consent to Dissolve from the Ministry of Finance, the corporation has 60 days to make its application for dissolution to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. The request for dissolution is mailed to the Companies and Personal Property Security Branch, 393 University Avenue, Suite 200, Toronto ON M5G 2M2. It must include:

The Letter of Consent to Dissolve Corporation.
Two sets of Articles of Dissolution with original signatures (blank articles available online).
A government fee made payable to the Minister of Finance.
If desired, you can also include the ServiceOntario Acknowledgement we have Received your Application Form, which allows you to provide the Ministry with an email address in order for them to confirm receipt of your request (this form is available online).
A covering letter providing a contact name, return address and telephone number.

If you wish to submit the application in person, you can do so at the Companies and Personal Property Security Branch office at 375 University Avenue, 2nd Floor, Toronto ON. It is advisable that you keep a copy of the documents you are submitting, and that you obtain a receipt, or a stamp from the Ministry, that shows they received your application.
Once your request is approved, the Ministry will mail you a copy of the Articles of Dissolution certified with their stamp and the date of the dissolution. The corporation is legally dissolved from the date of the certification.

Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law. First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three continuous years. Second, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living together by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether one person was financially supporting the other person, whether they have had a sexual relationship and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.

Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common-law spouse.
Social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for social assistance and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse's income on your application for benefits. Under the social assistance and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for three months, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse's employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under the Ontario Human Rights Code. It is important to note that the Human Rights Code is not applicable to matters between private parties so only government plans that exclude same-sex couples will be subject to constitutional challenges. However, in union situations, if the collective agreement contains specific provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, exclusion of same-sex couples from the employee benefit plan would be a violation of the agreement. You should check with your personnel department for information on your employee benefit plan.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"
				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as 'offer and acceptance'. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.

Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.

When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation - a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake - where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence - when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity - those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.

Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.

 
How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, in Ontario, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in the Consumer Protection Act and the Sale of Goods Act. In an attempt to protect consumers, these Acts set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, the Employment Standards Act applies. The provisions of the Act contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected. See topic 240 Employment contracts in this section of Legal Line for more information.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.
For more information about the responsibilities of a business under the Ontario Consumer Protection Act, refer to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				
What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
""(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.""

Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
""(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.""
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.
Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.
Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.
 
What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.

 
Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.
Visit Canada's Department of Justice for more information about criminal law and the justice system in Canada, or, view the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to see information regarding specific drug related offences.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Defamation: Libel and slander,480,"
				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else's reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person's reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else's reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person's reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
If you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

				The word ""condominium"" refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of, maintaining a number of facilities in the building called ""common elements."" Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are legally created once two documents are registered. These are the description and the declaration. The description consists of building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution of the condominium corporation and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against the keeping of pets. In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as the duties and powers of the board of directors of the condominium and the everyday rights and obligations of the residents and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation when the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and are given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium residents pay monthly common expenses. The amount of each resident's common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit, and the types of facilities offered by the condo. For example, condos with swimming pools and entertainment centers will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. These monthly fees can amount to quite a significant cost, so it is important to be aware of them before purchasing a condominium unit.

Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to fully investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, formally called an estoppel certificate, and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
You should pay particular attention to the reserve fund of the condominium corporation and ensure that there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium's major capital items. To do this, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving a status certificate, having five days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Additional information can also be obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Government and Consumer Services - Consumer Protection When Buying a Condo, and from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's Condominium Buyer's Guide.

Debt and Bankruptcy,Collection agencies,254,"
				Collection agencies are either hired by creditors to collect debts on their behalf, or collection agencies purchase debts at a discount and keep the entire amount if they are able to collect it.

In 2013, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act became law, providing stronger protections for Ontario consumers.
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. The first is that they must send you a written notice through the mail. This notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
After sending the notice, the agency must wait six days before it can contact you.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
There are a number of restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do. They cannot continue to contact you if:  (1) you send them a registered letter saying that you dispute the debt and suggest the matter be taken to court,  (2) you or your lawyer send them a registered letter providing your lawyer’s contact information and notifying the agency to communicate only with your lawyer, and (3) you are not the person they are looking for and you have told them so.
In addition, a collection agency cannot:

contact you on Sunday, except between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
contact you on any other day of the week between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
contact you on a statutory holiday
use profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person, etc.
tell you false or misleading information
tell you they have started a court action when they have not
add any extra fees or amounts to the money you owe.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency, or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, you may make a complaint to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.

Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult - posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone's email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion) – sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

How can you prevent cyberbullying?
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims' limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.
 
Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia's Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario's Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it,
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

 
Specifically, Ontario's Education Act states the following:
“bullying” means aggressive and typically repeated behaviour by a pupil where,
(a) the behaviour is intended by the pupil to have the effect of, or the pupil ought to know that the behaviour would be likely to have the effect of,
(i) causing harm, fear or distress to another individual, including physical, psychological, social or academic harm, harm to the individual’s reputation or harm to the individual’s property, or
(ii) creating a negative environment at a school for another individual, and
(b) the behaviour occurs in a context where there is a real or perceived power imbalance between the pupil and the individual based on factors such as size, strength, age, intelligence, peer group power, economic status, social status, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, family circumstances, gender, gender identity, gender expression, race, disability or the receipt of special education; (intimidation)""
 
In addition, the Education Act also provides a definition of cyberbullying:
""For the purposes of the definition of “bullying” in subsection (1), bullying includes bullying by electronic means (commonly known as cyber-bullying), including,
(a) creating a web page or a blog in which the creator assumes the identity of another person;
(b) impersonating another person as the author of content or messages posted on the internet; and
(c) communicating material electronically to more than one individual or posting material on a website that may be accessed by one or more individuals.""
The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.

Criminal Law,What is a criminal record?,793,"
				Not all dealings with the police result in a criminal record. For example, if the police give you a parking ticket, this is an offence under a municipal by-law and is not considered criminal. If you are charged with a provincial driving offence, such as an improper lane change, this is an offence under the Highway Traffic Act and is not criminal.
Having said that however, for practical purposes, any record held at a government office, containing information about a person's criminal activity or involvement is considered to be a type of criminal record.

Having said that however, for practical purposes, any record held at a government office, containing information about a person's criminal activity or involvement is considered to be a type of criminal record. This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.
For more information about removing a criminal record, call the Pardons Canada telephone support line, toll-free at 1-877-929-6011 or in Toronto at 416-929-6011, or visit their website at pardons.org.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Defamation: Libel and slander,480,"
				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else's reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person's reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else's reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person's reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
If you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to negligence or misdeeds by many professionals, such as doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and are usually extremely expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service ","
				Professional malpractice refers to negligence or misdeeds by many professionals, such as doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and are usually extremely expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practices, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service you required and the type of professional who provided it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, medical practitioners have an obligation, before administering any kind of medical treatment, to advise the patient fully of any associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has is based on the law, and the guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing full medical history to your doctor, or telling the truth about your case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible, and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out of pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for your pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession. For example, if your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. If your complaint is against an engineer, you may contact Professional Engineers Ontario.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother i","
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, under the Children's Law Reform Act, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child's father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the Family Law Act imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The Act provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16 years of age or older if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by the Child Support Guidelines of Ontario and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights under the Children's Law Reform Act.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

Types of mutual funds
The types of funds and what they invest in include:

Money market - Short-term fixed income securities like treasury bills
Fixed income - Fixed income securities like government bonds and corporate bonds
Growth or equity -  Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced  - A mix of equities and fixed income securities
Global  - Foreign equities or fixed income securities
Specialty  - Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index  - Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from the Ontario Securities Commission.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"

It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are (1) not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders, (2) in a not-for-profit corporation, the members are prohibited from receiving any pecuniary gain, and (3) not-for-profit corporations are established for purposes other than gain for their members. The purpose for establishing the corporation is set out in the Articles of Incorporation under the section called 'objects.' A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.
Structure of Ontario not-for-profit corporations
In Ontario, not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest.
As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how the business of the corporation will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the members of the corporation.
Structure of federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, it will also be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a ""certificate of continuance"" to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit company in Canada.

Board of directors
The affairs of a not-for-profit corporation are managed by a board of at least three directors. Directors must be or become members of the corporation, must be at least 18 years of age, and cannot be an undischarged bankrupt. The people named as the first directors in the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of other people appointed or elected in their place. The directors of a not-for-profit corporation are elected by its members. In turn, the directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties and removal of officers of the corporation are governed by its by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, others may be admitted to membership by the directors.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death or resignation of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations or unincorporated associations. However, a not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the objects of the corporation as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.
Auditor and records
To properly and legally run a not-for-profit corporation, an auditor must be appointed by its members every year, and certain records must be kept. These include proper books of account and accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions of the corporation, books containing minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the head office of the corporation and are to be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
More information about forming a not-for-profit in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario Not-for-Profit Guide.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Property?,157,"
				A Power of Attorney for Property is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills. The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your Will. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.","

The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your Will. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend. 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The kinds of things that your attorney can do depends entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney for Property that covers all of your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney for Property that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do, and when you are allowing them to do it. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future, or upon a specific occurrence, you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a ""Continuing Power of Attorney for Property"". This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, you should check with a lawyer to determine if it will have effect should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

be 18 years of age or older,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who is 18 years of age or older and mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a trust company to be your attorney for financial matters. Often people choose trust companies because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include, the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.
Drafting a Power of Attorney for Property involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer if you want to make a Power of Attorney for Property.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, at www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

Employment Law,Employment contracts,600,"
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee's salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed.
In Ontario, the relationship is governed by several statutes, including the Employment Standards Act, the Labour Relations Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. These statutes establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee's minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee's salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed.
In Ontario, the relationship is governed by several statutes, including the Employment Standards Act, the Labour Relations Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. These statutes establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee's minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee's duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer's promise of a job and the employee's promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract's duration, and
a description of the employee's duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee's rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee's job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee's position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For legal advice about employment contract matters, consult a lawyer.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"

				A Living Will is a document, or can form a part of a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date. It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.

In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Personal care can include decisions about many things, such as health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, but is usually included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will nor does it form part of a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
Is a Living Will enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Whether a Living Will is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
For more information about Living Wills, visit the Ministry of the Attorney General website at attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care, you should consult with a lawyer about making both a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will.

Also, Ontario's Dog Owners' Liability Act makes dog owners liable for any damage caused by bites to persons or other domestic animals. In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit them from owning a dog for a certain time.
Ontario also specifically bans ""pit bulls"" from being bred, imported or transferred through the province. Pit bulls in the province before 2005 are exempted. That said, a ""restricted pit bull"" must be muzzled, leashed and sterilized. An offence can result in a fine of up to $10,000 and/or six months in jail.

If you are in temporary financial need, Ontario Works can provide you with money, and help you find a job.
To be eligible, you must live in Ontario, need money right away to help pay for food and housing costs, and be willing to take part in activities that will help you find a job. Activities that will help you find a job are called Employment Assistance Activities and include: Education Programs, Job-Specific Skills Training, Literacy Screening and Training, Employment Placements, and Community Placements.
The amount of money you may receive from Ontario Works will depend on a number of factors including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.
You may also be eligible for the Ontario Child Benefit, which is available to help pay for the cost of the children's basic needs such as food and clothing.  For more information about the Ontario Child Benefit, visit the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.
To apply for Ontario Works benefits, you should call the nearest Ontario Works office and ask to speak with an intake worker. The intake worker will assess your situation and arrange an appointment to finalize your application at their office. Applications can also be made online at the Ministry of Community and Social Services website. Visit Ontario Works for more information.
 
Ontario Disability Support Program
People who are considered disabled according to the government's definition, can receive financial support and help finding a job through the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). To be eligible for disability benefits, you must complete the application process, which includes medical examinations.
Under the Ontario Disability Support Program, the amount you receive depends on your living arrangement.  It is made up of two portions: Income Support and Employment Support.
Income Support is meant to supplement other income. The basic needs portion of Income Support is meant to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and other necessary personal items. The amount you receive is based on a number of factors, including the number of people in your family and the age of your family members, where you live and how much you pay to live there, and your income and any assets you may have. The shelter allowance portion of the Income Support is meant to help cover such things as: rent or your mortgage payments, heat and utilities;  and is based on your actual shelter costs up to a maximum depending on the number of people in your family. Those who qualify for Income Support may also be eligible for other benefits such as drug and dental coverage, vision care, help with transportation costs, and wheelchair/mobility devise repairs and batteries.
Employment Support is also provided and helps people with disabilities, who can and want to work, prepare for and find a job.
To apply for benefits, call the nearest Ontario Disability Support Program office. Applications are also available online, or at your local ODSP office. It can take from a few weeks up to a few months to find out if you qualify for disability benefits. In the meantime, if you need help right away to pay for food, housing and other living costs, you can apply for financial assistance under Ontario Works. If you qualify, Ontario Works will be able to help you right away. They can also help you apply for Ontario Disability Support Program Income Support.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"

Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent.

				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, under the Children's Law Reform Act, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child's father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the Family Law Act imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The Act provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16 years of age or older if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by the Child Support Guidelines of Ontario and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights under the Children's Law Reform Act.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, and it ensures that your health will be in the hands of someone you have personally chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In this way, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is often similar to a Living Will.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued. Though a Living Will can be in any written form, it often forms part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

be 16 years of age or older, and
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney?
The term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

be 16 years of age or older,
be mentally competent, and
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

Above all, you should select someone who you know well, and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, you should ask the person if they are willing to be your attorney, and discuss with them your wishes and their responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly. You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by two witnesses.

The two witnesses must:

both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
not be the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or common-law partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.

 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer to prepare a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, at attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.

How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smell of alcohol. Under the law, the police have the right to stop your car and ask you if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with the police. You are required to provide the police with your driver's licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police also have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin, and following their finger with your eyes. Again, you are not required to co-operate with the police. However, failing to comply may lead the police to suspect that you are impaired, and they may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
In Ontario, if you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver's licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an Ignition interlock Program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver's seat, and is connected to the engine's ignition system.
In Ontario, drivers will be subject to the Ignition Interlock Program if they are:

convicted of an impaired driving or drinking and driving-related offence under the Criminal Code of Canada
suspended for registering a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05 to 0.08 three or more times in a five-year period.

First-time offenders will have an ignition interlock condition placed on their Ontario driver's licence for a minimum of 1 year, while second-time offenders will have the condition for a minimum of 3 years. Third-time offenders will have the condition on their licence indefinitely if it is reinstated after a minimum 10-year suspension. The program does not apply to fourth-time offenders, as their licence will never be reinstated.
For more information on the Ignition Interlock Program, visit the Ontario Ministry of Transportation website.
If you were at fault for an automobile accident while you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on ""Marriage Contracts,"" the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if the terms of the separation agreement were ordered by a court. If you are concerned that your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the separation agreement, the agreement can be filed with the Family Responsibility Office. By doing this, your agreement can be enforced without cost to you under the Family Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act. This office is funded by the Government of Ontario and has significant powers to enforce support payment under the agreement. You can also file the agreement with the court pursuant to the Family Law Act. For more information on filing your separation agreement, refer to the Family Responsibility Office or visit your local courthouse.
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important and each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements in Ontario, refer to the Ministry of the Attorney General.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?,154,"

Personal care can include your health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.

Personal care can include your health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, and it ensures that your health will be in the hands of someone you have personally chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In this way, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is often similar to a Living Will.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued. Though a Living Will can be in any written form, it often forms part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

be 16 years of age or older, and
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney?
The term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

be 16 years of age or older,
be mentally competent, and
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

Above all, you should select someone who you know well, and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, you should ask the person if they are willing to be your attorney, and discuss with them your wishes and their responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly. You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by two witnesses.

The two witnesses must:

both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
not be the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or common-law partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.

 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer to prepare a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts' willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go ""forum shopping"". Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet's broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet's potential audience without proper proof.

Money market - Short-term fixed income securities like treasury bills
Fixed income - Fixed income securities like government bonds and corporate bonds
Growth or equity -  Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced  - A mix of equities and fixed income securities

Specialty  - Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index  - Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				Not-for-profit organizations can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are (1) not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders, (2) in a not-for-profit corporation, the members are prohibited from receiving any pecuniary gain, and (3) not-for-profit corporations are established for purposes other than gain for their members. The purpose for establishing the corporation is set out in the Articles of Incorporation under the section called 'objects.' A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.
Structure of Ontario not-for-profit corporations
In Ontario, not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest.
As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how the business of the corporation will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the members of the corporation.
Structure of federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, it will also be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a ""certificate of continuance"" to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit company in Canada.

Board of directors
The affairs of a not-for-profit corporation are managed by a board of at least three directors. Directors must be or become members of the corporation, must be at least 18 years of age, and cannot be an undischarged bankrupt. The people named as the first directors in the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of other people appointed or elected in their place. The directors of a not-for-profit corporation are elected by its members. In turn, the directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties and removal of officers of the corporation are governed by its by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, others may be admitted to membership by the directors.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death or resignation of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations or unincorporated associations. However, a not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the objects of the corporation as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.
Auditor and records
To properly and legally run a not-for-profit corporation, an auditor must be appointed by its members every year, and certain records must be kept. These include proper books of account and accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions of the corporation, books containing minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the head office of the corporation and are to be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
More information about forming a not-for-profit in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario Not-for-Profit Guide.

Ontario Disability Support Program
People who are considered disabled according to the government's definition, can receive financial support and help finding a job through the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). To be eligible for disability benefits, you must complete the application process, which includes medical examinations.
Under the Ontario Disability Support Program, the amount you receive depends on your living arrangement.  It is made up of two portions: Income Support and Employment Support.
Income Support is meant to supplement other income. The basic needs portion of Income Support is meant to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and other necessary personal items. The amount you receive is based on a number of factors, including the number of people in your family and the age of your family members, where you live and how much you pay to live there, and your income and any assets you may have. The shelter allowance portion of the Income Support is meant to help cover such things as: rent or your mortgage payments, heat and utilities;  and is based on your actual shelter costs up to a maximum depending on the number of people in your family. Those who qualify for Income Support may also be eligible for other benefits such as drug and dental coverage, vision care, help with transportation costs, and wheelchair/mobility devise repairs and batteries.
Employment Support is also provided and helps people with disabilities, who can and want to work, prepare for and find a job.
To apply for benefits, call the nearest Ontario Disability Support Program office. Applications are also available online, or at your local ODSP office. It can take from a few weeks up to a few months to find out if you qualify for disability benefits. In the meantime, if you need help right away to pay for food, housing and other living costs, you can apply for financial assistance under Ontario Works. If you qualify, Ontario Works will be able to help you right away. They can also help you apply for Ontario Disability Support Program Income Support.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Property?,157,"
				A Power of Attorney for Property is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills. The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your Will. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.","

The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your Will. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend. 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The kinds of things that your attorney can do depends entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney for Property that covers all of your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney for Property that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do, and when you are allowing them to do it. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future, or upon a specific occurrence, you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a ""Continuing Power of Attorney for Property"". This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, you should check with a lawyer to determine if it will have effect should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

be 18 years of age or older,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who is 18 years of age or older and mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a trust company to be your attorney for financial matters. Often people choose trust companies because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include, the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.
Drafting a Power of Attorney for Property involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer if you want to make a Power of Attorney for Property.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, at www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on ""Marriage Contracts,"" the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if the terms of the separation agreement were ordered by a court. If you are concerned that your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the separation agreement, the agreement can be filed with the Family Responsibility Office. By doing this, your agreement can be enforced without cost to you under the Family Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act. This office is funded by the Government of Ontario and has significant powers to enforce support payment under the agreement. You can also file the agreement with the court pursuant to the Family Law Act. For more information on filing your separation agreement, refer to the Family Responsibility Office or visit your local courthouse.
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important and each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements in Ontario, refer to the Ministry of the Attorney General.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),What is a structured settlement?,486,"
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.

As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfils the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The ""guarantee period"" may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed-term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. The funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or their agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first and then purchase a structured settlement annuity yourself after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements, you should consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed.

What is 'cause' for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was 'cause', sometimes known as 'just cause'. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

What is not 'cause' for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but it is not a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee's work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.

Ontario Disability Support Program
People who are considered disabled according to the government's definition, can receive financial support and help finding a job through the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). To be eligible for disability benefits, you must complete the application process, which includes medical examinations.
Under the Ontario Disability Support Program, the amount you receive depends on your living arrangement.  It is made up of two portions: Income Support and Employment Support.
Income Support is meant to supplement other income. The basic needs portion of Income Support is meant to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and other necessary personal items. The amount you receive is based on a number of factors, including the number of people in your family and the age of your family members, where you live and how much you pay to live there, and your income and any assets you may have. The shelter allowance portion of the Income Support is meant to help cover such things as: rent or your mortgage payments, heat and utilities;  and is based on your actual shelter costs up to a maximum depending on the number of people in your family. Those who qualify for Income Support may also be eligible for other benefits such as drug and dental coverage, vision care, help with transportation costs, and wheelchair/mobility devise repairs and batteries.
Employment Support is also provided and helps people with disabilities, who can and want to work, prepare for and find a job.
To apply for benefits, call the nearest Ontario Disability Support Program office. Applications are also available online, or at your local ODSP office. It can take from a few weeks up to a few months to find out if you qualify for disability benefits. In the meantime, if you need help right away to pay for food, housing and other living costs, you can apply for financial assistance under Ontario Works. If you qualify, Ontario Works will be able to help you right away. They can also help you apply for Ontario Disability Support Program Income Support.

Employment Law,What is wrongful dismissal?,606,"
				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed. However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you. If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.

				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed. However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you. If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.
What is 'cause' for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was 'cause', sometimes known as 'just cause'. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

What is not 'cause' for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but it is not a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee's work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.
More information on termination of employment may also be found from the Ontario Ministry of Labour.

Business Law,Home businesses,235,"
				 
General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
 
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
 
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships, where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations, which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and Employment Insurance contributions from the employees' paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer's legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website. More information is also available from the Ministry of Labour.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
Special considerations for home businesses
1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence.
In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public's perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person's home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements. You can also visit ServiceOntario for more information about provincial licensing requirements.
Visit ontario.ca for a listing of Ontario Small Business Enterprise Centre locations where you can go for help to start and grow your business. More information about starting and operating a business in Ontario can also be found from the Government of Canada, Canada Business Ontario.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues which arise with a home business can be very complicated and have some unique requirements, it is advisable to consult a lawyer for advice and assistance.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information, visit the federal Department of Justice.

The types of funds and what they invest in include:

Money market - Short-term fixed income securities like treasury bills
Fixed income - Fixed income securities like government bonds and corporate bonds
Growth or equity -  Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced  - A mix of equities and fixed income securities
Global  - Foreign equities or fixed income securities
Specialty  - Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index  - Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from the Ontario Securities Commission.

Provincial: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
Federal: Access to Information Act

Provincial and municipal information
Informal request
To request information from a provincial or municipal office, you can first make an informal request by calling, writing or visiting the government office from which you want to collect the information. An online Directory of Records for provincial government organizations is available on the Ontario Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) website. Municipal government offices have their own directories available in a number of places, including city halls, police departments and boards of education.
Formal request

When making a request, both formal and informal, you must state the law under which the request is being made: the Provincial FIPPA, or the Municipal MFIPPA.
The Coordinator has 30 days to respond to your request.
Appeals to IPC
If your request is denied, you can appeal to the IPC by filling out forms available at the IPC office. Appeals must be made within 30 days of the government's decision. For more information, contact the Ontario Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner.

you believe you were improperly denied access to the information requested;
the request process is taking too long;
the request fees are too high;
you did not receive the information in your official language of choice; or
for other reasonable grounds.

Except in the case where your request is taking too long, you must submit your complaint to the OIC within 60 days of receiving your answer from the relevant federal institution.
The OIC will assign an Investigator to your case. The Investigator will give you an opportunity to present your complaint and will also obtain information from the federal institution in question. In many cases, the OIC Investigator will attempt to settle the complain by mediation, unless the Investigator decides the institution acted properly. The OIC will report its decision to you.
Appeals
Regardless of whether the OIC agrees with your complaint, you have the right to take your case to the Federal Court of Canada for a review of the federal institution's original decision.
In addition, the Commissioner may also decide to take a case to the Federal Court if it involves an important point of law. In such cases, the OIC must first receive your approval to do so.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are four main advantages to owning a franchise. First, you are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company. Second, you may not have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor. For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice. Third, you enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor's reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product. Fourth, it may be easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.
Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
The Franchise Disclosure Act
Ontario's Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000 or Franchise Disclosure Act is the law that governs all types of franchise relationships. The Act focuses on pre-sale disclosure, and impacts the way in which franchisors carry out the sales of their franchises. Detailed regulations governing the franchisor's behaviour are also a part of the Act, and franchisors must provide prospective frachisees with a 'disclosure document' before accepting any payments from prospective franchisees and before having prospective franchisees sign any agreement related to the franchise.
Franchisors are now required to disclose many important facts, such as the business background of the franchisor and its directors, partners and officers, and the litigation history of the franchisor. The disclosure document must contain copies of all franchise documentation to be signed by a prospective franchisee, including any restriction in the sourcing of supplies.
While the Act is largely about pre-sale disclosure and applies only to franchises sold after January 31, 2001, everyone should be aware of two very important provisions that affect existing franchise relationships:

The Act prohibits a franchisor from interfering with its franchisees' right to associate, and
It provides that ""Every franchise agreement imposes on each party a duty of fair dealing in its performance and enforcement.""

The obligation to deal fairly and conduct oneself in a commercially reasonable manner is an obligation imposed on both the franchisor and the franchisee and applies to all franchise agreements including those made before the Regulations.
There are many complicated legal issues involved with buying and operating franchises. You should consult a lawyer before entering into a franchise agreement.
More information about operating a franchise in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, or the Government of Canada, Canada Business Ontario.

In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and are usually extremely expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect.

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practices, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service you required and the type of professional who provided it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, medical practitioners have an obligation, before administering any kind of medical treatment, to advise the patient fully of any associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has is based on the law, and the guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing full medical history to your doctor, or telling the truth about your case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible, and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out of pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for your pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession. For example, if your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. If your complaint is against an engineer, you may contact Professional Engineers Ontario.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area.

There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will is a document, or can form a part of a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date. It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover.

In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Personal care can include decisions about many things, such as health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, but is usually included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will nor does it form part of a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
Is a Living Will enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Whether a Living Will is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
For more information about Living Wills, visit the Ministry of the Attorney General website at attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care, you should consult with a lawyer about making both a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will.

Business Law,Importing and exporting,236,"
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.
 
Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account bef","
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.
 
Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
 
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada's Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, refer to Canada Border Services Agency.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Ontario Business Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
Additional information can also be found from Canada Business Ontario.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

Some legal services can be provided by either a lawyer or a paralegal. In other situations, you must use a lawyer.  Every lawyer and paralegal practising in Ontario must be a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada. Lawyers and paralegals who provide legal services to the public are required to carry professional liability insurance.
In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that ""signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine"". In Ontario, notaries public are governed by the Notaries Act.  A lawyer can be a notary public, but not every notary public is a lawyer.  Also, notaries public do not have to undergo special education or training.  A notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B), a Juris Doctor (JD) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society.  In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer) or, a Law Practice Program (a combination of training and work placement).
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

Paralegals
Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Paralegals must complete a legal services program approved by the Law Society as well as licensing examinations. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and minor, limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or Wills and estates. For a more complete description of what a paralegal can do, refer to topic 857 Do you need a lawyer or paralegal?
Typically, paralegals' fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers' fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits.  An affidavit is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true.  A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other oaths, affirmations or declarations inside or outside of Ontario, or subject to any limit placed upon them by the Attorney General.
In Ontario, individuals who are not lawyers who wish to become a notary public or commissioner for taking oaths, may do so by completing an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. Applicants will only be considered if their employment requires the notarizing of documents in Ontario for:

Senior government officials
Ontario registered corporations engaged in international or inter-provincial trade and/or commerce
Patent and trademark agents
Head offices of national or provincial unions engaged in out-of-province business.

Visit the Ministry of the Attorney General for more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits.
Contact the Law Society of Upper Canada if you wish to confirm that an Ontario lawyer or licensed paralegal is entitled to provide legal services. This will help you make an informed decision on whether the person you are thinking of hiring is right for you.

It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are (1) not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders, (2) in a not-for-profit corporation, the members are prohibited from receiving any pecuniary gain, and (3) not-for-profit corporations are established for purposes other than gain for their members. The purpose for establishing the corporation is set out in the Articles of Incorporation under the section called 'objects.' A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.
Structure of Ontario not-for-profit corporations
In Ontario, not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest.
As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how the business of the corporation will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the members of the corporation.
Structure of federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, it will also be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a ""certificate of continuance"" to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit company in Canada.

Board of directors
The affairs of a not-for-profit corporation are managed by a board of at least three directors. Directors must be or become members of the corporation, must be at least 18 years of age, and cannot be an undischarged bankrupt. The people named as the first directors in the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of other people appointed or elected in their place. The directors of a not-for-profit corporation are elected by its members. In turn, the directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties and removal of officers of the corporation are governed by its by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, others may be admitted to membership by the directors.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death or resignation of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations or unincorporated associations. However, a not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the objects of the corporation as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.
Auditor and records
To properly and legally run a not-for-profit corporation, an auditor must be appointed by its members every year, and certain records must be kept. These include proper books of account and accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions of the corporation, books containing minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the head office of the corporation and are to be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
More information about forming a not-for-profit in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario Not-for-Profit Guide.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child.

				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, under the Children's Law Reform Act, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child's father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the Family Law Act imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The Act provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16 years of age or older if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by the Child Support Guidelines of Ontario and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights under the Children's Law Reform Act.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to negligence or misdeeds by many professionals, such as doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and are usually extremely expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service ","
				Professional malpractice refers to negligence or misdeeds by many professionals, such as doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and are usually extremely expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practices, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service you required and the type of professional who provided it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, medical practitioners have an obligation, before administering any kind of medical treatment, to advise the patient fully of any associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has is based on the law, and the guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing full medical history to your doctor, or telling the truth about your case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible, and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out of pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for your pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession. For example, if your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. If your complaint is against an engineer, you may contact Professional Engineers Ontario.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, and it ensures that your health will be in the hands of someone you have personally chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In this way, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is often similar to a Living Will.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued. Though a Living Will can be in any written form, it often forms part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

be 16 years of age or older, and
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney?
The term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

be 16 years of age or older,
be mentally competent, and
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

Above all, you should select someone who you know well, and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, you should ask the person if they are willing to be your attorney, and discuss with them your wishes and their responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly. You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by two witnesses.

The two witnesses must:

both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
not be the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or common-law partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.

 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer to prepare a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, at attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"

It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are (1) not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders, (2) in a not-for-profit corporation, the members are prohibited from receiving any pecuniary gain, and (3) not-for-profit corporations are established for purposes other than gain for their members. The purpose for establishing the corporation is set out in the Articles of Incorporation under the section called 'objects.' A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.
Structure of Ontario not-for-profit corporations
In Ontario, not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest.
As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how the business of the corporation will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the members of the corporation.
Structure of federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, it will also be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a ""certificate of continuance"" to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit company in Canada.

Board of directors
The affairs of a not-for-profit corporation are managed by a board of at least three directors. Directors must be or become members of the corporation, must be at least 18 years of age, and cannot be an undischarged bankrupt. The people named as the first directors in the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of other people appointed or elected in their place. The directors of a not-for-profit corporation are elected by its members. In turn, the directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties and removal of officers of the corporation are governed by its by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, others may be admitted to membership by the directors.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death or resignation of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations or unincorporated associations. However, a not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the objects of the corporation as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.
Auditor and records
To properly and legally run a not-for-profit corporation, an auditor must be appointed by its members every year, and certain records must be kept. These include proper books of account and accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions of the corporation, books containing minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the head office of the corporation and are to be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
More information about forming a not-for-profit in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario Not-for-Profit Guide.

Some legal services can be provided by either a lawyer or a paralegal. In other situations, you must use a lawyer.  Every lawyer and paralegal practising in Ontario must be a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada. Lawyers and paralegals who provide legal services to the public are required to carry professional liability insurance.
In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that ""signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine"". In Ontario, notaries public are governed by the Notaries Act.  A lawyer can be a notary public, but not every notary public is a lawyer.  Also, notaries public do not have to undergo special education or training.  A notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B), a Juris Doctor (JD) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society.  In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer) or, a Law Practice Program (a combination of training and work placement).
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

Paralegals
Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Paralegals must complete a legal services program approved by the Law Society as well as licensing examinations. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and minor, limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or Wills and estates. For a more complete description of what a paralegal can do, refer to topic 857 Do you need a lawyer or paralegal?
Typically, paralegals' fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers' fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits.  An affidavit is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true.  A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other oaths, affirmations or declarations inside or outside of Ontario, or subject to any limit placed upon them by the Attorney General.
In Ontario, individuals who are not lawyers who wish to become a notary public or commissioner for taking oaths, may do so by completing an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. Applicants will only be considered if their employment requires the notarizing of documents in Ontario for:

Senior government officials
Ontario registered corporations engaged in international or inter-provincial trade and/or commerce
Patent and trademark agents
Head offices of national or provincial unions engaged in out-of-province business.

Visit the Ministry of the Attorney General for more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits.
Contact the Law Society of Upper Canada if you wish to confirm that an Ontario lawyer or licensed paralegal is entitled to provide legal services. This will help you make an informed decision on whether the person you are thinking of hiring is right for you.

Money market - Short-term fixed income securities like treasury bills
Fixed income - Fixed income securities like government bonds and corporate bonds
Growth or equity -  Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced  - A mix of equities and fixed income securities

Specialty  - Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index  - Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child.

				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, under the Children's Law Reform Act, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child's father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the Family Law Act imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The Act provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16 years of age or older if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by the Child Support Guidelines of Ontario and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights under the Children's Law Reform Act.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on ""Marriage Contracts,"" the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if the terms of the separation agreement were ordered by a court. If you are concerned that your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the separation agreement, the agreement can be filed with the Family Responsibility Office. By doing this, your agreement can be enforced without cost to you under the Family Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act. This office is funded by the Government of Ontario and has significant powers to enforce support payment under the agreement. You can also file the agreement with the court pursuant to the Family Law Act. For more information on filing your separation agreement, refer to the Family Responsibility Office or visit your local courthouse.
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important and each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements in Ontario, refer to the Ministry of the Attorney General.

Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Property?,157,"
				A Power of Attorney for Property is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills. The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your Will. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.","
				A Power of Attorney for Property is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills. The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your Will. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend. 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The kinds of things that your attorney can do depends entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney for Property that covers all of your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney for Property that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do, and when you are allowing them to do it. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future, or upon a specific occurrence, you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a ""Continuing Power of Attorney for Property"". This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, you should check with a lawyer to determine if it will have effect should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

be 18 years of age or older,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who is 18 years of age or older and mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a trust company to be your attorney for financial matters. Often people choose trust companies because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include, the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.
Drafting a Power of Attorney for Property involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer if you want to make a Power of Attorney for Property.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, at www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?

				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations
Public foundations
Private foundations

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public's perspective.
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario guide on charitable status.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

After sending the notice, the agency must wait six days before it can contact you.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
There are a number of restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do. They cannot continue to contact you if:  (1) you send them a registered letter saying that you dispute the debt and suggest the matter be taken to court,  (2) you or your lawyer send them a registered letter providing your lawyer’s contact information and notifying the agency to communicate only with your lawyer, and (3) you are not the person they are looking for and you have told them so.
In addition, a collection agency cannot:

contact you on Sunday, except between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
contact you on any other day of the week between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
contact you on a statutory holiday
use profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person, etc.
tell you false or misleading information
tell you they have started a court action when they have not
add any extra fees or amounts to the money you owe.

Third, you can change your entire name for any other reason by completing An Application to Change an Adult's Name.  Last, you can apply to change your child's name by completing An Application to Change a Child's Name.  Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
The law governing name changes is the Change of Name Act.  All change of name applications are submitted to the Registrar General's office at:
Office of the Registrar General
PO Box 3000
189 Red River Road
Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5W0
Assuming your spouse's surname upon marriage and resuming your former surname upon divorce or death of spouse
When you get married, you can change your last name by assuming your spouse's last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name). To use this assumed name you do not need to make an application.
By using your government issued marriage certificate, and other government documents to prove your identity, Canadian citizenship and that you are an Ontario resident, you can obtain a new dirver's licence and health card. There is no cost to complete this type of surname change. Once you have a driver's licence with your new assumed surname, you will be able to use your assumed name on your bank accounts and conduct other business under this new name. This type of name change will not change the surname on your birth certificate.
If you get a divorce or annulment, or upon the death of your spouse, you may once again resume using the surname you had immediately prior to your marriage.  Because you assumed your spouse's surname and did not formally change your surname, you do not need to complete a formal application to resume using your previous name. In order to change your surname on government documents, such as a driver's licence, you will need to show your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate) together with documents (such as a birth certificate) showing the name you want to resume using.
 
Legally changing your last name upon marriage:
Election to Change Surname form
Upon marriage, in addition to the right to assume your spouse's surname, you have the right to legally change your last name to your spouse’s last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name) by completing the Election to Change Surname form. Unlike assuming your spouse's surname, this type of name change will appear on your Ontario birth certificate. You may also change your last name while you are living with a person in a conjugal relationship outside marriage. This applies to both opposite sex or same couples.
To legally change your last name upon marriage, you will need to complete the Election to Change Surname form, which applies to both those who are legally married and to those living in a common-law relationship.  There is no fee to submit this type of application provided you do so within 90 days of being married or of filing a joint declaration of conjugal relationship. After 90 days, the fee is $25. This form is only obtainable by calling 1-800-461-2156. In addition to completing this form, you will need to provide:

Your marriage certificate, or if living common-law, a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form
Birth Certificate(s)
Change of Name Certificate(s) (if applicable)
Police records check (if applicable)

After your application is processed you will receive a letter confirming the change.  You will then need to order a new Ontario birth certificate, which will show your new name as well as your previous name.  You will also be able to obtain other Ontario government issued documents, such as a driver's licence and health card, which will show your new surname.
 
Legally change your last name after divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse:
Election to Resume Former Surname form
After a marriage is dissolved by either a divorce, annulment or the death of your spouse, you may resume using the surname you had immediately before marriage.  If you legally changed your last name to that of your spouse by completing the Election to Change Surname form (as opposed to simply assuming your spouse's surname), then you will need to complete the Election to Resume Former Surname form.
In addition to the form, you will need to submit a copy of your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate), your change of name certificate, and your birth certificate, and submit these together with the $25 fee. This form can only be obtained by calling the Registrar General's office at 1-800-461-2156. Once the change has been completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.
It is important to know that the Election to Resume Former Surname application must be submitted within 90 days of the dissolution of your marriage, otherwise, you will be required to file a formal name change using the Application to Change an Adult's Name form, which is a longer application process.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage:
Application to Change an Adult's Name
The Application to Change an Adult's Name is used to change your name for other than martial reasons. With this type of application you can change all of your names, as opposed to only your surname. The fee is $137. This type of name change will change the name on your Ontario birth certificate. The form is available online at ontario.ca
To change your name for a reason other than marriage, you must be:•

16 years of age or older, and
have lived in Ontario for at least one year before submitting the application.

In addition to completing the form, you will be required to submit other documents such as:

if born in Canada, original birth certificate (or certified copy),
copy of marriage certificate (if you are currently married) or a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form (if you are living common-law)
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If you are 16 or 17 years old, and you are married, you can complete this application without the consent of your parents or guardian.  You will, however, need to submit proof of your marriage. If you are 16 or 17 years old and not married, you will need to obtain permission from your parents, guardians or anyone who has legal custody of you before you can change your name.
Once the name change is completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.

Changing a child’s last name
If you want to change the name of a child who is 17 years of age or younger and has lived in Ontario for at least the past 12 months, you must submit an Application to Change a Child's Name.  You must have legal custody of the child, and the child must be unmarried.  As with the adult application, this form can be obtained online at ontario.ca.  The fee to change a child's name is $22 for each child if they change their names at the same time as one of their parents.
In addition to the application form and the fee, you will need to submit other documents, such as:

birth certificate (or certified copy),
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If a child 16 or 17 years old would like to change their name on their own, they can do so if they are married, or if unmarried, as long as they have the written consent of their parents, legal guardian, or anyone who has legal custody of them. In either case, they need to use the Application to Change an Adult's Name and pay the $137 fee.
For more information on changing your name, you can call the Office of the Registrar General in Toronto at 416-325-8305 or toll-free 1-800-461-2156. Or visit ontario.ca.

				If parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, the other parent is usually responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of eighteen. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent's rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of 18 if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a ""father"" for the purposes of paying child support.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government  family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments and is based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the Ontario or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Ontario Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Ontario, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

As mentioned, the type of parenting arrangement, for example whether there is split, sole or joint custody, also affects the amount of child support paid.
The rules determining income can be complex but usually are calculated on a spouse's total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use these guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997 is neither deducted from the payer's income nor added to the recipient's income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997 these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don't want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement, for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.

However, some information is not readily available without requesting it, such as government salaries, internal memos, expenses, and reports on sensitive subject matters.
In Ontario, there are three main laws that regulate requests for information held by a government office:

Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (MFIPPA)
Provincial: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
Federal: Access to Information Act

Provincial and municipal information
Informal request
To request information from a provincial or municipal office, you can first make an informal request by calling, writing or visiting the government office from which you want to collect the information. An online Directory of Records for provincial government organizations is available on the Ontario Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) website. Municipal government offices have their own directories available in a number of places, including city halls, police departments and boards of education.
Formal request
If you are not able obtain the information you are looking for this way, you may submit a formal freedom of information request. To make a formal request, you must complete a request for information form. Request forms are available at most government offices. A generic request form is available online from the IPC website. You must then submit the request, along with a small fee, to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Coordinator at the government office from which you want to collect the information.
When making a request, both formal and informal, you must state the law under which the request is being made: the Provincial FIPPA, or the Municipal MFIPPA.
The Coordinator has 30 days to respond to your request.
Appeals to IPC
If your request is denied, you can appeal to the IPC by filling out forms available at the IPC office. Appeals must be made within 30 days of the government's decision. For more information, contact the Ontario Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner.
 
Federal information
For federal offices, you also have the option of making an informal request or a formal request. These requests are made pursuant to the Access to Information Act.
Informal request
To make an informal request for information, call the office you want information from and ask who in the office you should make the request to. Write a letter to this person requesting the information. If your informal request is denied, you make make a formal request.
Formal request
To make a formal request, you are required to fill out an Access to Information Request Form. A generic Access to Information Request form, which can be used for most federal offices, is available online from the Government of Canada website. There is no fee. Submit the request to the Access to Information Coordinator assigned to the federal office or agency you want information from.
Complaints
If your request is denied, or if you have a complaint about the procedure, you can speak with someone at the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada (OIC) to discuss your options. If you would like to make a complaint, you may do so for reasons, such as:

you believe you were improperly denied access to the information requested;
the request process is taking too long;
the request fees are too high;
you did not receive the information in your official language of choice; or
for other reasonable grounds.

Except in the case where your request is taking too long, you must submit your complaint to the OIC within 60 days of receiving your answer from the relevant federal institution.
The OIC will assign an Investigator to your case. The Investigator will give you an opportunity to present your complaint and will also obtain information from the federal institution in question. In many cases, the OIC Investigator will attempt to settle the complain by mediation, unless the Investigator decides the institution acted properly. The OIC will report its decision to you.
Appeals
Regardless of whether the OIC agrees with your complaint, you have the right to take your case to the Federal Court of Canada for a review of the federal institution's original decision.
In addition, the Commissioner may also decide to take a case to the Federal Court if it involves an important point of law. In such cases, the OIC must first receive your approval to do so.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are four main advantages to owning a franchise. First, you are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company. Second, you may not have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor. For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice. Third, you enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor's reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product. Fourth, it may be easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.
Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
The Franchise Disclosure Act
Ontario's Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000 or Franchise Disclosure Act is the law that governs all types of franchise relationships. The Act focuses on pre-sale disclosure, and impacts the way in which franchisors carry out the sales of their franchises. Detailed regulations governing the franchisor's behaviour are also a part of the Act, and franchisors must provide prospective frachisees with a 'disclosure document' before accepting any payments from prospective franchisees and before having prospective franchisees sign any agreement related to the franchise.
Franchisors are now required to disclose many important facts, such as the business background of the franchisor and its directors, partners and officers, and the litigation history of the franchisor. The disclosure document must contain copies of all franchise documentation to be signed by a prospective franchisee, including any restriction in the sourcing of supplies.
While the Act is largely about pre-sale disclosure and applies only to franchises sold after January 31, 2001, everyone should be aware of two very important provisions that affect existing franchise relationships:

The Act prohibits a franchisor from interfering with its franchisees' right to associate, and
It provides that ""Every franchise agreement imposes on each party a duty of fair dealing in its performance and enforcement.""

The obligation to deal fairly and conduct oneself in a commercially reasonable manner is an obligation imposed on both the franchisor and the franchisee and applies to all franchise agreements including those made before the Regulations.
There are many complicated legal issues involved with buying and operating franchises. You should consult a lawyer before entering into a franchise agreement.
More information about operating a franchise in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, or the Government of Canada, Canada Business Ontario.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee's salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed.
In Ontario, the relationship is governed by several statutes, including the Employment Standards Act, the Labour Relations Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. These statutes establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee's minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee's duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer's promise of a job and the employee's promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract's duration, and
a description of the employee's duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee's rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee's job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee's position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.

Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				Impaired driving means being in control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and is a serious offence under the Canadian Criminal Code. It is commonly referred to as drunk driving.
What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smell of alcohol. Under the law, the police have the right to stop your car and ask you if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with the police. You are required to provide the police with your driver's licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police also have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin, and following their finger with your eyes. Again, you are not required to co-operate with the police. However, failing to comply may lead the police to suspect that you are impaired, and they may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
In Ontario, if you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver's licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an Ignition interlock Program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver's seat, and is connected to the engine's ignition system.
In Ontario, drivers will be subject to the Ignition Interlock Program if they are:

convicted of an impaired driving or drinking and driving-related offence under the Criminal Code of Canada
suspended for registering a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05 to 0.08 three or more times in a five-year period.

First-time offenders will have an ignition interlock condition placed on their Ontario driver's licence for a minimum of 1 year, while second-time offenders will have the condition for a minimum of 3 years. Third-time offenders will have the condition on their licence indefinitely if it is reinstated after a minimum 10-year suspension. The program does not apply to fourth-time offenders, as their licence will never be reinstated.
For more information on the Ignition Interlock Program, visit the Ontario Ministry of Transportation website.
If you were at fault for an automobile accident while you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or, you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount you are owed is $25,000 or less or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor's assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor's assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means that you can take possession of the asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to make sure that your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business in Ontario, visit the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

Business Law,Home businesses,235,"
				 
General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
 
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships, where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded","
				 
General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
 
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships, where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations, which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and Employment Insurance contributions from the employees' paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer's legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website. More information is also available from the Ministry of Labour.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
Special considerations for home businesses
1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence.
In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public's perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person's home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements. You can also visit ServiceOntario for more information about provincial licensing requirements.
Visit ontario.ca for a listing of Ontario Small Business Enterprise Centre locations where you can go for help to start and grow your business. More information about starting and operating a business in Ontario can also be found from the Government of Canada, Canada Business Ontario.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues which arise with a home business can be very complicated and have some unique requirements, it is advisable to consult a lawyer for advice and assistance.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?,154,"
				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Personal care can include your health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.

Personal care can include your health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. Although the person you give this power to is called your ""attorney,"" it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, and it ensures that your health will be in the hands of someone you have personally chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In this way, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is often similar to a Living Will.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued. Though a Living Will can be in any written form, it often forms part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

be 16 years of age or older, and
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney?
The term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

be 16 years of age or older,
be mentally competent, and
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

Above all, you should select someone who you know well, and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, you should ask the person if they are willing to be your attorney, and discuss with them your wishes and their responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly. You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by two witnesses.

The two witnesses must:

both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
not be the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or common-law partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.

 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer to prepare a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, at attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.

				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult - posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone's email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion) – sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

How can you prevent cyberbullying?
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims' limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.
 
Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia's Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario's Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it,
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

 
Specifically, Ontario's Education Act states the following:
“bullying” means aggressive and typically repeated behaviour by a pupil where,
(a) the behaviour is intended by the pupil to have the effect of, or the pupil ought to know that the behaviour would be likely to have the effect of,
(i) causing harm, fear or distress to another individual, including physical, psychological, social or academic harm, harm to the individual’s reputation or harm to the individual’s property, or
(ii) creating a negative environment at a school for another individual, and
(b) the behaviour occurs in a context where there is a real or perceived power imbalance between the pupil and the individual based on factors such as size, strength, age, intelligence, peer group power, economic status, social status, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, family circumstances, gender, gender identity, gender expression, race, disability or the receipt of special education; (intimidation)""
 
In addition, the Education Act also provides a definition of cyberbullying:
""For the purposes of the definition of “bullying” in subsection (1), bullying includes bullying by electronic means (commonly known as cyber-bullying), including,
(a) creating a web page or a blog in which the creator assumes the identity of another person;
(b) impersonating another person as the author of content or messages posted on the internet; and
(c) communicating material electronically to more than one individual or posting material on a website that may be accessed by one or more individuals.""
The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP's Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

In 2013, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act became law, providing stronger protections for Ontario consumers.
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. The first is that they must send you a written notice through the mail. This notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
After sending the notice, the agency must wait six days before it can contact you.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
There are a number of restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do. They cannot continue to contact you if:  (1) you send them a registered letter saying that you dispute the debt and suggest the matter be taken to court,  (2) you or your lawyer send them a registered letter providing your lawyer’s contact information and notifying the agency to communicate only with your lawyer, and (3) you are not the person they are looking for and you have told them so.
In addition, a collection agency cannot:

contact you on Sunday, except between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
contact you on any other day of the week between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
contact you on a statutory holiday
use profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person, etc.
tell you false or misleading information
tell you they have started a court action when they have not
add any extra fees or amounts to the money you owe.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency, or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, you may make a complaint to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				
What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
""(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.""

(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.""
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.
Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.
Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.
 
What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.

 
Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.
Visit Canada's Department of Justice for more information about criminal law and the justice system in Canada, or, view the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to see information regarding specific drug related offences.

				The word ""condominium"" refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of, maintaining a number of facilities in the building called ""common elements."" Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.

				The word ""condominium"" refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of, maintaining a number of facilities in the building called ""common elements."" Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are legally created once two documents are registered. These are the description and the declaration. The description consists of building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution of the condominium corporation and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against the keeping of pets. In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as the duties and powers of the board of directors of the condominium and the everyday rights and obligations of the residents and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation when the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and are given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium residents pay monthly common expenses. The amount of each resident's common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit, and the types of facilities offered by the condo. For example, condos with swimming pools and entertainment centers will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. These monthly fees can amount to quite a significant cost, so it is important to be aware of them before purchasing a condominium unit.

Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to fully investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, formally called an estoppel certificate, and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
You should pay particular attention to the reserve fund of the condominium corporation and ensure that there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium's major capital items. To do this, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving a status certificate, having five days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Additional information can also be obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Government and Consumer Services - Consumer Protection When Buying a Condo, and from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's Condominium Buyer's Guide.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Class actions: Starting a lawsuit with others,468,"
				Class actions are lawsuits that involve a group of people who have all suffered a similar type of injury from the same cause. Rather than each individual beginning their own lawsuit, they join to sue the particular person or company for compensation. For example, a group of people may have all been injured by a defective product or may all have suffered injury and financial losses as a result of a major accident. Usually, one person or a small group of people begin the lawsuit, with others joining as time goes by. They may be formally notified of the lawsuit by mail, or they may just read about it in the newspaper.

Usually, one person or a small group of people begin the lawsuit, with others joining as time goes by. They may be formally notified of the lawsuit by mail, or they may just read about it in the newspaper.
Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or 'certified' by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant's costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

Business Law,Extending credit and credit checks,229,"
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means that the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt. Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
A Writ of Execution search,

				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means that the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt. Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the Ontario Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
A Writ of Execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver's Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

1.  Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can take security on the debtor's assets, usually the one you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor. A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral. To conduct this search, you can use the Access Now online service provided by the Ontario Government. In addition, you will also be able to register a personal property lien using the Access Now service.
There is a small fee for each name or vehicle identification number searched.
2.  Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus in Ontario: Equifax and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3.  Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you may search the Ministry of Attorney General database. Local searches of the Writs System can be performed at any enforcement office of the Ministry by its staff, but only with respect to writs of execution filed in the local jurisdiction. Teranet offers enhanced services at any Land Registry Office (LRO) through Teranet’s ROSCO terminals or remotely through Teraview for writ searches across all sheriff/enforcement office jurisdictions. End users can also access services through Teranet’s Teranet eXpress website to perform searches of the Writs System by enforcement office or across the province and can issue and file Writs of Execution electronically. For more information, visit Teranet.
You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a fee. There are also commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4.  Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5.  Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
To search for information on an Ontario corporation, you must complete a Government of Ontario, Corporation Profile Report. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6.  Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7.  Search at Official Receiver's office
Next, a search at the Official Receiver's office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether they have filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8.  Vehicle record and driver record search
Finally, Vehicle Record or Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, you must complete specific forms that are available at the Ministry of Transportation. There is a small fee for each search conducted.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

Internet and Cyber Law,Defamation laws (cyber-libel) and the Internet,361,"

The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person's reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements.

Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts' willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go ""forum shopping"". Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet's broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet's potential audience without proper proof.

Having said that however, for practical purposes, any record held at a government office, containing information about a person's criminal activity or involvement is considered to be a type of criminal record. This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.

				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.
 
Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account bef","

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
 
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada's Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, refer to Canada Border Services Agency.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Ontario Business Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
Additional information can also be found from Canada Business Ontario.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult - posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone's email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion) – sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

How can you prevent cyberbullying?
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims' limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.
 
Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia's Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario's Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it,
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

 
Specifically, Ontario's Education Act states the following:
“bullying” means aggressive and typically repeated behaviour by a pupil where,
(a) the behaviour is intended by the pupil to have the effect of, or the pupil ought to know that the behaviour would be likely to have the effect of,
(i) causing harm, fear or distress to another individual, including physical, psychological, social or academic harm, harm to the individual’s reputation or harm to the individual’s property, or
(ii) creating a negative environment at a school for another individual, and
(b) the behaviour occurs in a context where there is a real or perceived power imbalance between the pupil and the individual based on factors such as size, strength, age, intelligence, peer group power, economic status, social status, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, family circumstances, gender, gender identity, gender expression, race, disability or the receipt of special education; (intimidation)""
 
In addition, the Education Act also provides a definition of cyberbullying:
""For the purposes of the definition of “bullying” in subsection (1), bullying includes bullying by electronic means (commonly known as cyber-bullying), including,
(a) creating a web page or a blog in which the creator assumes the identity of another person;
(b) impersonating another person as the author of content or messages posted on the internet; and
(c) communicating material electronically to more than one individual or posting material on a website that may be accessed by one or more individuals.""
The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP's Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

The Ontario Government administers two different social assistance programs that provide financial support to people without an income because they cannot find work, or they are disabled.  These programs are the Ontario Works Program, which is administered by your local municipality, and the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) which is administered by the Province.
Ontario Works Program
If you are in temporary financial need, Ontario Works can provide you with money, and help you find a job.
To be eligible, you must live in Ontario, need money right away to help pay for food and housing costs, and be willing to take part in activities that will help you find a job. Activities that will help you find a job are called Employment Assistance Activities and include: Education Programs, Job-Specific Skills Training, Literacy Screening and Training, Employment Placements, and Community Placements.
The amount of money you may receive from Ontario Works will depend on a number of factors including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.
You may also be eligible for the Ontario Child Benefit, which is available to help pay for the cost of the children's basic needs such as food and clothing.  For more information about the Ontario Child Benefit, visit the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.
To apply for Ontario Works benefits, you should call the nearest Ontario Works office and ask to speak with an intake worker. The intake worker will assess your situation and arrange an appointment to finalize your application at their office. Applications can also be made online at the Ministry of Community and Social Services website. Visit Ontario Works for more information.
 
Ontario Disability Support Program
People who are considered disabled according to the government's definition, can receive financial support and help finding a job through the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). To be eligible for disability benefits, you must complete the application process, which includes medical examinations.
Under the Ontario Disability Support Program, the amount you receive depends on your living arrangement.  It is made up of two portions: Income Support and Employment Support.
Income Support is meant to supplement other income. The basic needs portion of Income Support is meant to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and other necessary personal items. The amount you receive is based on a number of factors, including the number of people in your family and the age of your family members, where you live and how much you pay to live there, and your income and any assets you may have. The shelter allowance portion of the Income Support is meant to help cover such things as: rent or your mortgage payments, heat and utilities;  and is based on your actual shelter costs up to a maximum depending on the number of people in your family. Those who qualify for Income Support may also be eligible for other benefits such as drug and dental coverage, vision care, help with transportation costs, and wheelchair/mobility devise repairs and batteries.
Employment Support is also provided and helps people with disabilities, who can and want to work, prepare for and find a job.
To apply for benefits, call the nearest Ontario Disability Support Program office. Applications are also available online, or at your local ODSP office. It can take from a few weeks up to a few months to find out if you qualify for disability benefits. In the meantime, if you need help right away to pay for food, housing and other living costs, you can apply for financial assistance under Ontario Works. If you qualify, Ontario Works will be able to help you right away. They can also help you apply for Ontario Disability Support Program Income Support.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under the Ontario Business Corporations Act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
 
Steps to dissolve a corporation
Although a corporation incorporated in Ontario may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all Ontario tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services will deny the application for dissolution.
In order to dissolve an Ontario corporation, an application first must be made to the Ministry of Finance requesting its consent. The corporation must send a letter to the Ministry of Finance, Client Services Branch requesting them to provide a Letter of Consent to Dissolve Corporation. In the request, you must include the full corporate name, the Ontario incorporation number, and the federal Business Number. The request must be signed by an authorized director of the corporation.
Once the corporation receives the Consent to Dissolve from the Ministry of Finance, the corporation has 60 days to make its application for dissolution to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. The request for dissolution is mailed to the Companies and Personal Property Security Branch, 393 University Avenue, Suite 200, Toronto ON M5G 2M2. It must include:

The Letter of Consent to Dissolve Corporation.
Two sets of Articles of Dissolution with original signatures (blank articles available online).
A government fee made payable to the Minister of Finance.
If desired, you can also include the ServiceOntario Acknowledgement we have Received your Application Form, which allows you to provide the Ministry with an email address in order for them to confirm receipt of your request (this form is available online).
A covering letter providing a contact name, return address and telephone number.

If you wish to submit the application in person, you can do so at the Companies and Personal Property Security Branch office at 375 University Avenue, 2nd Floor, Toronto ON. It is advisable that you keep a copy of the documents you are submitting, and that you obtain a receipt, or a stamp from the Ministry, that shows they received your application.
Once your request is approved, the Ministry will mail you a copy of the Articles of Dissolution certified with their stamp and the date of the dissolution. The corporation is legally dissolved from the date of the certification.
For information on closing your business, visit ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's Canada Business Ontario. For information on dissolving a business incorporated under the federal Canada Business Corporations Act, visit Corporations Canada.

Family Law,Common-law relationships,121,"

Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.

Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law. First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three continuous years. Second, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living together by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether one person was financially supporting the other person, whether they have had a sexual relationship and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common-law spouse.
Social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for social assistance and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse's income on your application for benefits. Under the social assistance and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for three months, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse's employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under the Ontario Human Rights Code. It is important to note that the Human Rights Code is not applicable to matters between private parties so only government plans that exclude same-sex couples will be subject to constitutional challenges. However, in union situations, if the collective agreement contains specific provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, exclusion of same-sex couples from the employee benefit plan would be a violation of the agreement. You should check with your personnel department for information on your employee benefit plan.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

Also, Ontario's Dog Owners' Liability Act makes dog owners liable for any damage caused by bites to persons or other domestic animals. In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit them from owning a dog for a certain time.
Ontario also specifically bans ""pit bulls"" from being bred, imported or transferred through the province. Pit bulls in the province before 2005 are exempted. That said, a ""restricted pit bull"" must be muzzled, leashed and sterilized. An offence can result in a fine of up to $10,000 and/or six months in jail.

Other purposes beneficial to the community.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations
Public foundations
Private foundations

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public's perspective.
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on ""Marriage Contracts,"" the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if the terms of the separation agreement were ordered by a court. If you are concerned that your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the separation agreement, the agreement can be filed with the Family Responsibility Office. By doing this, your agreement can be enforced without cost to you under the Family Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act. This office is funded by the Government of Ontario and has significant powers to enforce support payment under the agreement. You can also file the agreement with the court pursuant to the Family Law Act. For more information on filing your separation agreement, refer to the Family Responsibility Office or visit your local courthouse.
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important and each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements in Ontario, refer to the Ministry of the Attorney General.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as 'offer and acceptance'. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.

Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.

When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation - a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake - where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence - when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity - those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.

Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.

 
How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, in Ontario, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in the Consumer Protection Act and the Sale of Goods Act. In an attempt to protect consumers, these Acts set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, the Employment Standards Act applies. The provisions of the Act contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected. See topic 240 Employment contracts in this section of Legal Line for more information.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.
For more information about the responsibilities of a business under the Ontario Consumer Protection Act, refer to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

You will also need to ensure that all tax filings, such as payroll and GST/HST, are up-to-date and that no taxes are owing. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information regarding closing tax accounts.
Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under the Ontario Business Corporations Act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
 
Steps to dissolve a corporation
Although a corporation incorporated in Ontario may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all Ontario tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services will deny the application for dissolution.
In order to dissolve an Ontario corporation, an application first must be made to the Ministry of Finance requesting its consent. The corporation must send a letter to the Ministry of Finance, Client Services Branch requesting them to provide a Letter of Consent to Dissolve Corporation. In the request, you must include the full corporate name, the Ontario incorporation number, and the federal Business Number. The request must be signed by an authorized director of the corporation.
Once the corporation receives the Consent to Dissolve from the Ministry of Finance, the corporation has 60 days to make its application for dissolution to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. The request for dissolution is mailed to the Companies and Personal Property Security Branch, 393 University Avenue, Suite 200, Toronto ON M5G 2M2. It must include:

The Letter of Consent to Dissolve Corporation.
Two sets of Articles of Dissolution with original signatures (blank articles available online).
A government fee made payable to the Minister of Finance.
If desired, you can also include the ServiceOntario Acknowledgement we have Received your Application Form, which allows you to provide the Ministry with an email address in order for them to confirm receipt of your request (this form is available online).
A covering letter providing a contact name, return address and telephone number.

If you wish to submit the application in person, you can do so at the Companies and Personal Property Security Branch office at 375 University Avenue, 2nd Floor, Toronto ON. It is advisable that you keep a copy of the documents you are submitting, and that you obtain a receipt, or a stamp from the Ministry, that shows they received your application.
Once your request is approved, the Ministry will mail you a copy of the Articles of Dissolution certified with their stamp and the date of the dissolution. The corporation is legally dissolved from the date of the certification.
For information on closing your business, visit ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's Canada Business Ontario. For information on dissolving a business incorporated under the federal Canada Business Corporations Act, visit Corporations Canada.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information, visit the federal Department of Justice.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				The Ontario government has established a number of rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child.

Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Birth parents must register the birth of their child within 30 days of the birth, giving the child a legal identity and ensuring that the child will get certain documents, such as a birth certificate and a passport. The child must be at least seven days old before written permission for adoption can be given and the natural parents then have 21 days to change their mind and cancel the permission. If permission is cancelled within the 21 days, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the 21 days has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their mind about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents' consent.
 
How to adopt a child in Ontario
There are generally two ways to adopt a child in Ontario. The first is a public adoption through the Children's Aid Society. The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licenced by the Ontario Government.
To adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved the Society will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the adoption order is given by the court. There is no cost for parents to adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society public adoption process.
The process to adopt a child through a private agency is very similar to that of adopting a child through the Children's Aid Society. For a private adoption, you must contact a private adoption practitioner that has been approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. In addition, you will be charged a fee for the private services, which is generally between $15,000 and $25,000.
 
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, you do not need to go through the Children's Aid Society or a private adoption agency. However, you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order. An assessment by an adoption practitioner is not needed for this type of adoption, unless the judge requires it.
However, if you wish to adopt a family member who lives outside Canada, there are a number of steps you must take, including:

complete a homestudy assessment and training program,
be approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services,
apply through an Ontario agency licensed to handle adoptions in the child's home country, and
submit an application to Canadian immigration to get permission for your adopted child to move to Canada.

 
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 - Adopting a child from abroad.
 
The approval process for all adoptions
Ontario residents are required to complete two programs as part of the approval process for either a private, public or international adoption:
1) The Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) homestudy is completed by licensed social workers approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services before approving the arrangements for the adoption. The purpose of homestudy is to assess the ability of the applicants to parent an adopted child, and involves discussions with an adoption worker about the adoptive parents attitudes towards parenting as well as exploring their values and beliefs. It can include references, medical reports and other personal information.
2) The Parent Resources for Information and Development and Education (PRIDE) program is a standardized training program to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child. The curriculum involves a variety of areas such as: the importance of connections to the child's birth family and kin, and the importance of cultural and racial awareness.
For more information about adopting a child in Ontario, contact the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For legal advice and assistance, contact a lawyer.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life.

As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfils the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The ""guarantee period"" may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed-term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. The funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or their agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first and then purchase a structured settlement annuity yourself after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements, you should consult a lawyer.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations
Public foundations
Private foundations

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public's perspective.
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.

What is 'cause' for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was 'cause', sometimes known as 'just cause'. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

What is not 'cause' for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but it is not a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee's work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.

Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
 
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

Family Law,Child support,117,"
				If parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, the other parent is usually responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by ","
				If parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, the other parent is usually responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of eighteen. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent's rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of 18 if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a ""father"" for the purposes of paying child support.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government  family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments and is based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the Ontario or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Ontario Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Ontario, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

As mentioned, the type of parenting arrangement, for example whether there is split, sole or joint custody, also affects the amount of child support paid.
The rules determining income can be complex but usually are calculated on a spouse's total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use these guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997 is neither deducted from the payer's income nor added to the recipient's income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997 these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don't want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement, for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.
More information is also available from the federal Department of Justice.

They may be formally notified of the lawsuit by mail, or they may just read about it in the newspaper.
Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or 'certified' by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant's costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

				The word ""condominium"" refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of, maintaining a number of facilities in the building called ""common elements."" Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are legally created once two documents are registered. These are the description and the declaration. The description consists of building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution of the condominium corporation and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against the keeping of pets. In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as the duties and powers of the board of directors of the condominium and the everyday rights and obligations of the residents and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation when the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and are given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium residents pay monthly common expenses. The amount of each resident's common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit, and the types of facilities offered by the condo. For example, condos with swimming pools and entertainment centers will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. These monthly fees can amount to quite a significant cost, so it is important to be aware of them before purchasing a condominium unit.

Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to fully investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, formally called an estoppel certificate, and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
You should pay particular attention to the reserve fund of the condominium corporation and ensure that there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium's major capital items. To do this, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving a status certificate, having five days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Additional information can also be obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Government and Consumer Services - Consumer Protection When Buying a Condo, and from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's Condominium Buyer's Guide.

The right to change one's surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.

The right to change one's surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
Third, you can change your entire name for any other reason by completing An Application to Change an Adult's Name.  Last, you can apply to change your child's name by completing An Application to Change a Child's Name.  Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
The law governing name changes is the Change of Name Act.  All change of name applications are submitted to the Registrar General's office at:
Office of the Registrar General
PO Box 3000
189 Red River Road
Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5W0
Assuming your spouse's surname upon marriage and resuming your former surname upon divorce or death of spouse
When you get married, you can change your last name by assuming your spouse's last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name). To use this assumed name you do not need to make an application.
By using your government issued marriage certificate, and other government documents to prove your identity, Canadian citizenship and that you are an Ontario resident, you can obtain a new dirver's licence and health card. There is no cost to complete this type of surname change. Once you have a driver's licence with your new assumed surname, you will be able to use your assumed name on your bank accounts and conduct other business under this new name. This type of name change will not change the surname on your birth certificate.
If you get a divorce or annulment, or upon the death of your spouse, you may once again resume using the surname you had immediately prior to your marriage.  Because you assumed your spouse's surname and did not formally change your surname, you do not need to complete a formal application to resume using your previous name. In order to change your surname on government documents, such as a driver's licence, you will need to show your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate) together with documents (such as a birth certificate) showing the name you want to resume using.
 
Legally changing your last name upon marriage:
Election to Change Surname form
Upon marriage, in addition to the right to assume your spouse's surname, you have the right to legally change your last name to your spouse’s last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name) by completing the Election to Change Surname form. Unlike assuming your spouse's surname, this type of name change will appear on your Ontario birth certificate. You may also change your last name while you are living with a person in a conjugal relationship outside marriage. This applies to both opposite sex or same couples.
To legally change your last name upon marriage, you will need to complete the Election to Change Surname form, which applies to both those who are legally married and to those living in a common-law relationship.  There is no fee to submit this type of application provided you do so within 90 days of being married or of filing a joint declaration of conjugal relationship. After 90 days, the fee is $25. This form is only obtainable by calling 1-800-461-2156. In addition to completing this form, you will need to provide:

Your marriage certificate, or if living common-law, a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form
Birth Certificate(s)
Change of Name Certificate(s) (if applicable)
Police records check (if applicable)

After your application is processed you will receive a letter confirming the change.  You will then need to order a new Ontario birth certificate, which will show your new name as well as your previous name.  You will also be able to obtain other Ontario government issued documents, such as a driver's licence and health card, which will show your new surname.
 
Legally change your last name after divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse:
Election to Resume Former Surname form
After a marriage is dissolved by either a divorce, annulment or the death of your spouse, you may resume using the surname you had immediately before marriage.  If you legally changed your last name to that of your spouse by completing the Election to Change Surname form (as opposed to simply assuming your spouse's surname), then you will need to complete the Election to Resume Former Surname form.
In addition to the form, you will need to submit a copy of your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate), your change of name certificate, and your birth certificate, and submit these together with the $25 fee. This form can only be obtained by calling the Registrar General's office at 1-800-461-2156. Once the change has been completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.
It is important to know that the Election to Resume Former Surname application must be submitted within 90 days of the dissolution of your marriage, otherwise, you will be required to file a formal name change using the Application to Change an Adult's Name form, which is a longer application process.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage:
Application to Change an Adult's Name
The Application to Change an Adult's Name is used to change your name for other than martial reasons. With this type of application you can change all of your names, as opposed to only your surname. The fee is $137. This type of name change will change the name on your Ontario birth certificate. The form is available online at ontario.ca
To change your name for a reason other than marriage, you must be:•

16 years of age or older, and
have lived in Ontario for at least one year before submitting the application.

In addition to completing the form, you will be required to submit other documents such as:

if born in Canada, original birth certificate (or certified copy),
copy of marriage certificate (if you are currently married) or a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form (if you are living common-law)
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If you are 16 or 17 years old, and you are married, you can complete this application without the consent of your parents or guardian.  You will, however, need to submit proof of your marriage. If you are 16 or 17 years old and not married, you will need to obtain permission from your parents, guardians or anyone who has legal custody of you before you can change your name.
Once the name change is completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.

Changing a child’s last name
If you want to change the name of a child who is 17 years of age or younger and has lived in Ontario for at least the past 12 months, you must submit an Application to Change a Child's Name.  You must have legal custody of the child, and the child must be unmarried.  As with the adult application, this form can be obtained online at ontario.ca.  The fee to change a child's name is $22 for each child if they change their names at the same time as one of their parents.
In addition to the application form and the fee, you will need to submit other documents, such as:

birth certificate (or certified copy),
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If a child 16 or 17 years old would like to change their name on their own, they can do so if they are married, or if unmarried, as long as they have the written consent of their parents, legal guardian, or anyone who has legal custody of them. In either case, they need to use the Application to Change an Adult's Name and pay the $137 fee.
For more information on changing your name, you can call the Office of the Registrar General in Toronto at 416-325-8305 or toll-free 1-800-461-2156. Or visit ontario.ca.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				
What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
""(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)

""(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.""
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.
Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.
Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.
 
What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.

 
Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.

				Sometimes a business is owed money either by an individual or by another business. The person or business who owes you money is called a debtor and you are called the creditor. If you have trouble getting the money you are owed, there are several steps you should follow.
Contact the debtor
First, you should always telephone or contact the debtor in person. The debtor may only need a friendly reminder of the money owed, and you should always try to be on good terms with the people you do business with. If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what they owe you. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt, and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or, you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount you are owed is $25,000 or less or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor's assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor's assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means that you can take possession of the asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to make sure that your business does not experience cash flow problems.

				Not all dealings with the police result in a criminal record. For example, if the police give you a parking ticket, this is an offence under a municipal by-law and is not considered criminal.

This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.
For more information about removing a criminal record, call the Pardons Canada telephone support line, toll-free at 1-877-929-6011 or in Toronto at 416-929-6011, or visit their website at pardons.org.

A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as 'offer and acceptance'. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.

Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.

When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation - a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake - where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence - when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity - those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.

Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.

 
How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, in Ontario, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in the Consumer Protection Act and the Sale of Goods Act. In an attempt to protect consumers, these Acts set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, the Employment Standards Act applies. The provisions of the Act contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected. See topic 240 Employment contracts in this section of Legal Line for more information.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.
For more information about the responsibilities of a business under the Ontario Consumer Protection Act, refer to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

The customer then owes the business a debt.

The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means that the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt. Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the Ontario Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
A Writ of Execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver's Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

1.  Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can take security on the debtor's assets, usually the one you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor. A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral. To conduct this search, you can use the Access Now online service provided by the Ontario Government. In addition, you will also be able to register a personal property lien using the Access Now service.
There is a small fee for each name or vehicle identification number searched.
2.  Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus in Ontario: Equifax and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3.  Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you may search the Ministry of Attorney General database. Local searches of the Writs System can be performed at any enforcement office of the Ministry by its staff, but only with respect to writs of execution filed in the local jurisdiction. Teranet offers enhanced services at any Land Registry Office (LRO) through Teranet’s ROSCO terminals or remotely through Teraview for writ searches across all sheriff/enforcement office jurisdictions. End users can also access services through Teranet’s Teranet eXpress website to perform searches of the Writs System by enforcement office or across the province and can issue and file Writs of Execution electronically. For more information, visit Teranet.
You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a fee. There are also commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4.  Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5.  Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
To search for information on an Ontario corporation, you must complete a Government of Ontario, Corporation Profile Report. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6.  Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7.  Search at Official Receiver's office
Next, a search at the Official Receiver's office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether they have filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8.  Vehicle record and driver record search
Finally, Vehicle Record or Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, you must complete specific forms that are available at the Ministry of Transportation. There is a small fee for each search conducted.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfils the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The ""guarantee period"" may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed-term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. The funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or their agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first and then purchase a structured settlement annuity yourself after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements, you should consult a lawyer.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on ""Marriage Contracts,"" the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if the terms of the separation agreement were ordered by a court. If you are concerned that your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the separation agreement, the agreement can be filed with the Family Responsibility Office. By doing this, your agreement can be enforced without cost to you under the Family Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act. This office is funded by the Government of Ontario and has significant powers to enforce support payment under the agreement. You can also file the agreement with the court pursuant to the Family Law Act. For more information on filing your separation agreement, refer to the Family Responsibility Office or visit your local courthouse.
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important and each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements in Ontario, refer to the Ministry of the Attorney General.

Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law. First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three continuous years. Second, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living together by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether one person was financially supporting the other person, whether they have had a sexual relationship and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common-law spouse.
Social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for social assistance and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse's income on your application for benefits. Under the social assistance and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for three months, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse's employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under the Ontario Human Rights Code. It is important to note that the Human Rights Code is not applicable to matters between private parties so only government plans that exclude same-sex couples will be subject to constitutional challenges. However, in union situations, if the collective agreement contains specific provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, exclusion of same-sex couples from the employee benefit plan would be a violation of the agreement. You should check with your personnel department for information on your employee benefit plan.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect.

				Professional malpractice refers to negligence or misdeeds by many professionals, such as doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and are usually extremely expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practices, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service you required and the type of professional who provided it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, medical practitioners have an obligation, before administering any kind of medical treatment, to advise the patient fully of any associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has is based on the law, and the guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing full medical history to your doctor, or telling the truth about your case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible, and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out of pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for your pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession. For example, if your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. If your complaint is against an engineer, you may contact Professional Engineers Ontario.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.
What is 'cause' for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was 'cause', sometimes known as 'just cause'. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

What is not 'cause' for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but it is not a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee's work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.

Specialty  - Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index  - Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.

You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child.

Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Birth parents must register the birth of their child within 30 days of the birth, giving the child a legal identity and ensuring that the child will get certain documents, such as a birth certificate and a passport. The child must be at least seven days old before written permission for adoption can be given and the natural parents then have 21 days to change their mind and cancel the permission. If permission is cancelled within the 21 days, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the 21 days has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their mind about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents' consent.
 
How to adopt a child in Ontario
There are generally two ways to adopt a child in Ontario. The first is a public adoption through the Children's Aid Society. The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licenced by the Ontario Government.
To adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved the Society will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the adoption order is given by the court. There is no cost for parents to adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society public adoption process.
The process to adopt a child through a private agency is very similar to that of adopting a child through the Children's Aid Society. For a private adoption, you must contact a private adoption practitioner that has been approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. In addition, you will be charged a fee for the private services, which is generally between $15,000 and $25,000.
 
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, you do not need to go through the Children's Aid Society or a private adoption agency. However, you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order. An assessment by an adoption practitioner is not needed for this type of adoption, unless the judge requires it.
However, if you wish to adopt a family member who lives outside Canada, there are a number of steps you must take, including:

complete a homestudy assessment and training program,
be approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services,
apply through an Ontario agency licensed to handle adoptions in the child's home country, and
submit an application to Canadian immigration to get permission for your adopted child to move to Canada.

 
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 - Adopting a child from abroad.
 
The approval process for all adoptions
Ontario residents are required to complete two programs as part of the approval process for either a private, public or international adoption:
1) The Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) homestudy is completed by licensed social workers approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services before approving the arrangements for the adoption. The purpose of homestudy is to assess the ability of the applicants to parent an adopted child, and involves discussions with an adoption worker about the adoptive parents attitudes towards parenting as well as exploring their values and beliefs. It can include references, medical reports and other personal information.
2) The Parent Resources for Information and Development and Education (PRIDE) program is a standardized training program to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child. The curriculum involves a variety of areas such as: the importance of connections to the child's birth family and kin, and the importance of cultural and racial awareness.
For more information about adopting a child in Ontario, contact the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For legal advice and assistance, contact a lawyer.

There are four ways to change your name.  First, you can assume your spouse's surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.  Second, you can legally change your surname based on marital status by completing an Election to Change Surname form.

The right to change one's surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
Third, you can change your entire name for any other reason by completing An Application to Change an Adult's Name.  Last, you can apply to change your child's name by completing An Application to Change a Child's Name.  Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
The law governing name changes is the Change of Name Act.  All change of name applications are submitted to the Registrar General's office at:
Office of the Registrar General
PO Box 3000
189 Red River Road
Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5W0
Assuming your spouse's surname upon marriage and resuming your former surname upon divorce or death of spouse
When you get married, you can change your last name by assuming your spouse's last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name). To use this assumed name you do not need to make an application.
By using your government issued marriage certificate, and other government documents to prove your identity, Canadian citizenship and that you are an Ontario resident, you can obtain a new dirver's licence and health card. There is no cost to complete this type of surname change. Once you have a driver's licence with your new assumed surname, you will be able to use your assumed name on your bank accounts and conduct other business under this new name. This type of name change will not change the surname on your birth certificate.
If you get a divorce or annulment, or upon the death of your spouse, you may once again resume using the surname you had immediately prior to your marriage.  Because you assumed your spouse's surname and did not formally change your surname, you do not need to complete a formal application to resume using your previous name. In order to change your surname on government documents, such as a driver's licence, you will need to show your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate) together with documents (such as a birth certificate) showing the name you want to resume using.
 
Legally changing your last name upon marriage:
Election to Change Surname form
Upon marriage, in addition to the right to assume your spouse's surname, you have the right to legally change your last name to your spouse’s last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name) by completing the Election to Change Surname form. Unlike assuming your spouse's surname, this type of name change will appear on your Ontario birth certificate. You may also change your last name while you are living with a person in a conjugal relationship outside marriage. This applies to both opposite sex or same couples.
To legally change your last name upon marriage, you will need to complete the Election to Change Surname form, which applies to both those who are legally married and to those living in a common-law relationship.  There is no fee to submit this type of application provided you do so within 90 days of being married or of filing a joint declaration of conjugal relationship. After 90 days, the fee is $25. This form is only obtainable by calling 1-800-461-2156. In addition to completing this form, you will need to provide:

Your marriage certificate, or if living common-law, a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form
Birth Certificate(s)
Change of Name Certificate(s) (if applicable)
Police records check (if applicable)

After your application is processed you will receive a letter confirming the change.  You will then need to order a new Ontario birth certificate, which will show your new name as well as your previous name.  You will also be able to obtain other Ontario government issued documents, such as a driver's licence and health card, which will show your new surname.
 
Legally change your last name after divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse:
Election to Resume Former Surname form
After a marriage is dissolved by either a divorce, annulment or the death of your spouse, you may resume using the surname you had immediately before marriage.  If you legally changed your last name to that of your spouse by completing the Election to Change Surname form (as opposed to simply assuming your spouse's surname), then you will need to complete the Election to Resume Former Surname form.
In addition to the form, you will need to submit a copy of your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate), your change of name certificate, and your birth certificate, and submit these together with the $25 fee. This form can only be obtained by calling the Registrar General's office at 1-800-461-2156. Once the change has been completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.
It is important to know that the Election to Resume Former Surname application must be submitted within 90 days of the dissolution of your marriage, otherwise, you will be required to file a formal name change using the Application to Change an Adult's Name form, which is a longer application process.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage:
Application to Change an Adult's Name
The Application to Change an Adult's Name is used to change your name for other than martial reasons. With this type of application you can change all of your names, as opposed to only your surname. The fee is $137. This type of name change will change the name on your Ontario birth certificate. The form is available online at ontario.ca
To change your name for a reason other than marriage, you must be:•

16 years of age or older, and
have lived in Ontario for at least one year before submitting the application.

In addition to completing the form, you will be required to submit other documents such as:

if born in Canada, original birth certificate (or certified copy),
copy of marriage certificate (if you are currently married) or a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form (if you are living common-law)
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If you are 16 or 17 years old, and you are married, you can complete this application without the consent of your parents or guardian.  You will, however, need to submit proof of your marriage. If you are 16 or 17 years old and not married, you will need to obtain permission from your parents, guardians or anyone who has legal custody of you before you can change your name.
Once the name change is completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.

Changing a child’s last name
If you want to change the name of a child who is 17 years of age or younger and has lived in Ontario for at least the past 12 months, you must submit an Application to Change a Child's Name.  You must have legal custody of the child, and the child must be unmarried.  As with the adult application, this form can be obtained online at ontario.ca.  The fee to change a child's name is $22 for each child if they change their names at the same time as one of their parents.
In addition to the application form and the fee, you will need to submit other documents, such as:

birth certificate (or certified copy),
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If a child 16 or 17 years old would like to change their name on their own, they can do so if they are married, or if unmarried, as long as they have the written consent of their parents, legal guardian, or anyone who has legal custody of them. In either case, they need to use the Application to Change an Adult's Name and pay the $137 fee.
For more information on changing your name, you can call the Office of the Registrar General in Toronto at 416-325-8305 or toll-free 1-800-461-2156. Or visit ontario.ca.

				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.
 
Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
 
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada's Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, refer to Canada Border Services Agency.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Ontario Business Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
Additional information can also be found from Canada Business Ontario.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

The Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect published in 2003 and again in 2008 by the Public Health Agency of Canada, cited a number of contributing factors, such as poverty, poor housing conditions, neglect, substance abuse and exposure to family violence. This report was compiled using information and data gathered from child welfare agencies in every province and territory. Furthermore, the 2008 report included data from three times as many First Nations agencies from previous reports. The increased number of First Nations child welfare agencies participating in the study allows for a more accurate picture of the reasons why Aboriginal children are overrepresented in the child welfare system.
In appropriate situations, the Children’s Aid Society can intervene and remove a child from the parents’ custody if it can show to the court that the child is in need of protection. This includes situations where the parent is unable to provide care to the child or where the child has suffered harm (physical or emotional) from the parent. The applicable law is the Child and Family Services Act (CFSA).
Under CFSA, there are special provisions that apply to Aboriginal children. For example, the child’s First Nation council must be given notice of the court case, and the child’s cultural identity must be considered when an order is being made. Specifically, section 37(4) of the CFSA states:
“ Where a person is directed in this Part to make an order or determination in the best interests of a child and the child is an Indian or native person, the person shall take into consideration the importance, in recognition of the uniqueness of Indian and native culture, heritage and traditions, of preserving the child’s cultural identity.”

Government of Canada - First Nations Child and Family Services
The federal government’s First Nations Child and Family Services (FNCFS) program was established to ensure the safety and well-being of First Nations children ordinarily resident on reserve. The program funds child and family services agencies that are established, managed and controlled by First Nations. The program is delegated by provincial or territorial authority, or services provided by provincial or territorial organizations or departments where the family resides. The services provided by the province or territory are in line with the laws and standards of the province. Also, the services must be provided in a similar manner to all residents of the province who are receiving assistance from FNCFS.
 
Provincial child welfare services
The province or territory, where the child resides, is responsible for funding the delivery of child welfare services for all other children living off reserve. Each province and territory has its own child protection legislation designed to focus on child safety and well-being. In addition, provinces and territories have implemented several programs that provide culturally appropriate services specifically for Aboriginal children and youth.

Business Law,Home businesses,235,"
				 
General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
 
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships, where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded","

Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
 
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships, where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations, which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and Employment Insurance contributions from the employees' paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer's legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website. More information is also available from the Ministry of Labour.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
Special considerations for home businesses
1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence.
In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public's perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person's home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements. You can also visit ServiceOntario for more information about provincial licensing requirements.
Visit ontario.ca for a listing of Ontario Small Business Enterprise Centre locations where you can go for help to start and grow your business. More information about starting and operating a business in Ontario can also be found from the Government of Canada, Canada Business Ontario.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues which arise with a home business can be very complicated and have some unique requirements, it is advisable to consult a lawyer for advice and assistance.

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

Any money remaining after the sale of the assets must be returned to the business. If the business assets are not sufficient to repay the bank loan, the bank can take legal action against the guarantors.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company, and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee's business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are four main advantages to owning a franchise. First, you are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company. Second, you may not have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor. For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice. Third, you enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor's reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product. Fourth, it may be easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.
Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
The Franchise Disclosure Act
Ontario's Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000 or Franchise Disclosure Act is the law that governs all types of franchise relationships. The Act focuses on pre-sale disclosure, and impacts the way in which franchisors carry out the sales of their franchises. Detailed regulations governing the franchisor's behaviour are also a part of the Act, and franchisors must provide prospective frachisees with a 'disclosure document' before accepting any payments from prospective franchisees and before having prospective franchisees sign any agreement related to the franchise.
Franchisors are now required to disclose many important facts, such as the business background of the franchisor and its directors, partners and officers, and the litigation history of the franchisor. The disclosure document must contain copies of all franchise documentation to be signed by a prospective franchisee, including any restriction in the sourcing of supplies.
While the Act is largely about pre-sale disclosure and applies only to franchises sold after January 31, 2001, everyone should be aware of two very important provisions that affect existing franchise relationships:

The Act prohibits a franchisor from interfering with its franchisees' right to associate, and
It provides that ""Every franchise agreement imposes on each party a duty of fair dealing in its performance and enforcement.""

The obligation to deal fairly and conduct oneself in a commercially reasonable manner is an obligation imposed on both the franchisor and the franchisee and applies to all franchise agreements including those made before the Regulations.
There are many complicated legal issues involved with buying and operating franchises. You should consult a lawyer before entering into a franchise agreement.

This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.

However, some information is not readily available without requesting it, such as government salaries, internal memos, expenses, and reports on sensitive subject matters.
In Ontario, there are three main laws that regulate requests for information held by a government office:

Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (MFIPPA)
Provincial: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
Federal: Access to Information Act

Provincial and municipal information
Informal request
To request information from a provincial or municipal office, you can first make an informal request by calling, writing or visiting the government office from which you want to collect the information. An online Directory of Records for provincial government organizations is available on the Ontario Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) website. Municipal government offices have their own directories available in a number of places, including city halls, police departments and boards of education.
Formal request
If you are not able obtain the information you are looking for this way, you may submit a formal freedom of information request. To make a formal request, you must complete a request for information form. Request forms are available at most government offices. A generic request form is available online from the IPC website. You must then submit the request, along with a small fee, to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Coordinator at the government office from which you want to collect the information.
When making a request, both formal and informal, you must state the law under which the request is being made: the Provincial FIPPA, or the Municipal MFIPPA.
The Coordinator has 30 days to respond to your request.
Appeals to IPC
If your request is denied, you can appeal to the IPC by filling out forms available at the IPC office. Appeals must be made within 30 days of the government's decision. For more information, contact the Ontario Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner.
 
Federal information
For federal offices, you also have the option of making an informal request or a formal request. These requests are made pursuant to the Access to Information Act.

Complaints
If your request is denied, or if you have a complaint about the procedure, you can speak with someone at the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada (OIC) to discuss your options. If you would like to make a complaint, you may do so for reasons, such as:

you believe you were improperly denied access to the information requested;
the request process is taking too long;
the request fees are too high;
you did not receive the information in your official language of choice; or
for other reasonable grounds.

Except in the case where your request is taking too long, you must submit your complaint to the OIC within 60 days of receiving your answer from the relevant federal institution.
The OIC will assign an Investigator to your case. The Investigator will give you an opportunity to present your complaint and will also obtain information from the federal institution in question. In many cases, the OIC Investigator will attempt to settle the complain by mediation, unless the Investigator decides the institution acted properly. The OIC will report its decision to you.
Appeals
Regardless of whether the OIC agrees with your complaint, you have the right to take your case to the Federal Court of Canada for a review of the federal institution's original decision.
In addition, the Commissioner may also decide to take a case to the Federal Court if it involves an important point of law. In such cases, the OIC must first receive your approval to do so.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

To be eligible for disability benefits, you must complete the application process, which includes medical examinations.
Under the Ontario Disability Support Program, the amount you receive depends on your living arrangement.  It is made up of two portions: Income Support and Employment Support.
Income Support is meant to supplement other income. The basic needs portion of Income Support is meant to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and other necessary personal items.

For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfils the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The ""guarantee period"" may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed-term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. The funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or their agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first and then purchase a structured settlement annuity yourself after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements, you should consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

				Canada's Anti-terrorism Act, 2015 (the Act) received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015.
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
 
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"

Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as 'offer and acceptance'. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.

Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.

When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation - a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake - where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence - when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity - those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.

Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.

 
How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, in Ontario, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in the Consumer Protection Act and the Sale of Goods Act. In an attempt to protect consumers, these Acts set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, the Employment Standards Act applies. The provisions of the Act contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected. See topic 240 Employment contracts in this section of Legal Line for more information.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.
For more information about the responsibilities of a business under the Ontario Consumer Protection Act, refer to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

Family Law,Common-law relationships,121,"

Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law. First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three continuous years. Second, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living together by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether one person was financially supporting the other person, whether they have had a sexual relationship and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common-law spouse.
Social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for social assistance and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse's income on your application for benefits. Under the social assistance and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for three months, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse's employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under the Ontario Human Rights Code. It is important to note that the Human Rights Code is not applicable to matters between private parties so only government plans that exclude same-sex couples will be subject to constitutional challenges. However, in union situations, if the collective agreement contains specific provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, exclusion of same-sex couples from the employee benefit plan would be a violation of the agreement. You should check with your personnel department for information on your employee benefit plan.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

In 2013, the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act became law, providing stronger protections for Ontario consumers.
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. The first is that they must send you a written notice through the mail. This notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
After sending the notice, the agency must wait six days before it can contact you.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
There are a number of restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do. They cannot continue to contact you if:  (1) you send them a registered letter saying that you dispute the debt and suggest the matter be taken to court,  (2) you or your lawyer send them a registered letter providing your lawyer’s contact information and notifying the agency to communicate only with your lawyer, and (3) you are not the person they are looking for and you have told them so.
In addition, a collection agency cannot:

contact you on Sunday, except between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
contact you on any other day of the week between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
contact you on a statutory holiday
use profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person, etc.
tell you false or misleading information
tell you they have started a court action when they have not

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				The Ontario government has established a number of rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child.

Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Birth parents must register the birth of their child within 30 days of the birth, giving the child a legal identity and ensuring that the child will get certain documents, such as a birth certificate and a passport. The child must be at least seven days old before written permission for adoption can be given and the natural parents then have 21 days to change their mind and cancel the permission. If permission is cancelled within the 21 days, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the 21 days has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their mind about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents' consent.
 
How to adopt a child in Ontario
There are generally two ways to adopt a child in Ontario. The first is a public adoption through the Children's Aid Society. The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licenced by the Ontario Government.
To adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved the Society will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the adoption order is given by the court. There is no cost for parents to adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society public adoption process.
The process to adopt a child through a private agency is very similar to that of adopting a child through the Children's Aid Society. For a private adoption, you must contact a private adoption practitioner that has been approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. In addition, you will be charged a fee for the private services, which is generally between $15,000 and $25,000.
 
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, you do not need to go through the Children's Aid Society or a private adoption agency. However, you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order. An assessment by an adoption practitioner is not needed for this type of adoption, unless the judge requires it.
However, if you wish to adopt a family member who lives outside Canada, there are a number of steps you must take, including:

complete a homestudy assessment and training program,
be approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services,
apply through an Ontario agency licensed to handle adoptions in the child's home country, and
submit an application to Canadian immigration to get permission for your adopted child to move to Canada.

 
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 - Adopting a child from abroad.
 
The approval process for all adoptions
Ontario residents are required to complete two programs as part of the approval process for either a private, public or international adoption:
1) The Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) homestudy is completed by licensed social workers approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services before approving the arrangements for the adoption. The purpose of homestudy is to assess the ability of the applicants to parent an adopted child, and involves discussions with an adoption worker about the adoptive parents attitudes towards parenting as well as exploring their values and beliefs. It can include references, medical reports and other personal information.
2) The Parent Resources for Information and Development and Education (PRIDE) program is a standardized training program to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child. The curriculum involves a variety of areas such as: the importance of connections to the child's birth family and kin, and the importance of cultural and racial awareness.
For more information about adopting a child in Ontario, contact the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For legal advice and assistance, contact a lawyer.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or 'certified' by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant's costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

When you get married, you can change your last name by assuming your spouse's last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name). To use this assumed name you do not need to make an application.
By using your government issued marriage certificate, and other government documents to prove your identity, Canadian citizenship and that you are an Ontario resident, you can obtain a new dirver's licence and health card. There is no cost to complete this type of surname change. Once you have a driver's licence with your new assumed surname, you will be able to use your assumed name on your bank accounts and conduct other business under this new name. This type of name change will not change the surname on your birth certificate.
If you get a divorce or annulment, or upon the death of your spouse, you may once again resume using the surname you had immediately prior to your marriage.  Because you assumed your spouse's surname and did not formally change your surname, you do not need to complete a formal application to resume using your previous name. In order to change your surname on government documents, such as a driver's licence, you will need to show your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate) together with documents (such as a birth certificate) showing the name you want to resume using.
 
Legally changing your last name upon marriage:
Election to Change Surname form
Upon marriage, in addition to the right to assume your spouse's surname, you have the right to legally change your last name to your spouse’s last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name) by completing the Election to Change Surname form. Unlike assuming your spouse's surname, this type of name change will appear on your Ontario birth certificate. You may also change your last name while you are living with a person in a conjugal relationship outside marriage. This applies to both opposite sex or same couples.
To legally change your last name upon marriage, you will need to complete the Election to Change Surname form, which applies to both those who are legally married and to those living in a common-law relationship.  There is no fee to submit this type of application provided you do so within 90 days of being married or of filing a joint declaration of conjugal relationship. After 90 days, the fee is $25. This form is only obtainable by calling 1-800-461-2156. In addition to completing this form, you will need to provide:

Your marriage certificate, or if living common-law, a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form
Birth Certificate(s)
Change of Name Certificate(s) (if applicable)
Police records check (if applicable)

After your application is processed you will receive a letter confirming the change.  You will then need to order a new Ontario birth certificate, which will show your new name as well as your previous name.  You will also be able to obtain other Ontario government issued documents, such as a driver's licence and health card, which will show your new surname.
 
Legally change your last name after divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse:
Election to Resume Former Surname form
After a marriage is dissolved by either a divorce, annulment or the death of your spouse, you may resume using the surname you had immediately before marriage.  If you legally changed your last name to that of your spouse by completing the Election to Change Surname form (as opposed to simply assuming your spouse's surname), then you will need to complete the Election to Resume Former Surname form.
In addition to the form, you will need to submit a copy of your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate), your change of name certificate, and your birth certificate, and submit these together with the $25 fee. This form can only be obtained by calling the Registrar General's office at 1-800-461-2156. Once the change has been completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.
It is important to know that the Election to Resume Former Surname application must be submitted within 90 days of the dissolution of your marriage, otherwise, you will be required to file a formal name change using the Application to Change an Adult's Name form, which is a longer application process.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage:
Application to Change an Adult's Name
The Application to Change an Adult's Name is used to change your name for other than martial reasons. With this type of application you can change all of your names, as opposed to only your surname. The fee is $137. This type of name change will change the name on your Ontario birth certificate. The form is available online at ontario.ca
To change your name for a reason other than marriage, you must be:•

16 years of age or older, and
have lived in Ontario for at least one year before submitting the application.

In addition to completing the form, you will be required to submit other documents such as:

if born in Canada, original birth certificate (or certified copy),
copy of marriage certificate (if you are currently married) or a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form (if you are living common-law)
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If you are 16 or 17 years old, and you are married, you can complete this application without the consent of your parents or guardian.  You will, however, need to submit proof of your marriage. If you are 16 or 17 years old and not married, you will need to obtain permission from your parents, guardians or anyone who has legal custody of you before you can change your name.
Once the name change is completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.

Changing a child’s last name
If you want to change the name of a child who is 17 years of age or younger and has lived in Ontario for at least the past 12 months, you must submit an Application to Change a Child's Name.  You must have legal custody of the child, and the child must be unmarried.  As with the adult application, this form can be obtained online at ontario.ca.  The fee to change a child's name is $22 for each child if they change their names at the same time as one of their parents.
In addition to the application form and the fee, you will need to submit other documents, such as:

birth certificate (or certified copy),
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If a child 16 or 17 years old would like to change their name on their own, they can do so if they are married, or if unmarried, as long as they have the written consent of their parents, legal guardian, or anyone who has legal custody of them. In either case, they need to use the Application to Change an Adult's Name and pay the $137 fee.
For more information on changing your name, you can call the Office of the Registrar General in Toronto at 416-325-8305 or toll-free 1-800-461-2156. Or visit ontario.ca.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will is a document, or can form a part of a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date. It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.

				A Living Will is a document, or can form a part of a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date. It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Personal care can include decisions about many things, such as health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, but is usually included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will nor does it form part of a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
Is a Living Will enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Whether a Living Will is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
For more information about Living Wills, visit the Ministry of the Attorney General website at attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care, you should consult with a lawyer about making both a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will.

Some legal services can be provided by either a lawyer or a paralegal. In other situations, you must use a lawyer.  Every lawyer and paralegal practising in Ontario must be a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada. Lawyers and paralegals who provide legal services to the public are required to carry professional liability insurance.
In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that ""signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine"". In Ontario, notaries public are governed by the Notaries Act.  A lawyer can be a notary public, but not every notary public is a lawyer.  Also, notaries public do not have to undergo special education or training.  A notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B), a Juris Doctor (JD) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society.  In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer) or, a Law Practice Program (a combination of training and work placement).
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

Paralegals
Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Paralegals must complete a legal services program approved by the Law Society as well as licensing examinations. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and minor, limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or Wills and estates. For a more complete description of what a paralegal can do, refer to topic 857 Do you need a lawyer or paralegal?
Typically, paralegals' fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers' fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits.  An affidavit is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true.  A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other oaths, affirmations or declarations inside or outside of Ontario, or subject to any limit placed upon them by the Attorney General.
In Ontario, individuals who are not lawyers who wish to become a notary public or commissioner for taking oaths, may do so by completing an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. Applicants will only be considered if their employment requires the notarizing of documents in Ontario for:

Senior government officials
Ontario registered corporations engaged in international or inter-provincial trade and/or commerce
Patent and trademark agents
Head offices of national or provincial unions engaged in out-of-province business.

Visit the Ministry of the Attorney General for more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits.
Contact the Law Society of Upper Canada if you wish to confirm that an Ontario lawyer or licensed paralegal is entitled to provide legal services. This will help you make an informed decision on whether the person you are thinking of hiring is right for you.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),What is a structured settlement?,486,"
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.

				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfils the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The ""guarantee period"" may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed-term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. The funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or their agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first and then purchase a structured settlement annuity yourself after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements, you should consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother i","
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, under the Children's Law Reform Act, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child's father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the Family Law Act imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The Act provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16 years of age or older if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by the Child Support Guidelines of Ontario and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights under the Children's Law Reform Act.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are (1) not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders, (2) in a not-for-profit corporation, the members are prohibited from receiving any pecuniary gain, and (3) not-for-profit corporations are established for purposes other than gain for their members. The purpose for establishing the corporation is set out in the Articles of Incorporation under the section called 'objects.' A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.
Structure of Ontario not-for-profit corporations
In Ontario, not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest.
As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how the business of the corporation will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the members of the corporation.
Structure of federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, it will also be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a ""certificate of continuance"" to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit company in Canada.

Board of directors
The affairs of a not-for-profit corporation are managed by a board of at least three directors. Directors must be or become members of the corporation, must be at least 18 years of age, and cannot be an undischarged bankrupt. The people named as the first directors in the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of other people appointed or elected in their place. The directors of a not-for-profit corporation are elected by its members. In turn, the directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties and removal of officers of the corporation are governed by its by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, others may be admitted to membership by the directors.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death or resignation of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations or unincorporated associations. However, a not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the objects of the corporation as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.
Auditor and records
To properly and legally run a not-for-profit corporation, an auditor must be appointed by its members every year, and certain records must be kept. These include proper books of account and accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions of the corporation, books containing minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the head office of the corporation and are to be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
More information about forming a not-for-profit in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario Not-for-Profit Guide.

				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay.

If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.
What is 'cause' for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was 'cause', sometimes known as 'just cause'. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

What is not 'cause' for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but it is not a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee's work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;

Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information, visit the federal Department of Justice.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				The Ontario government has established a number of rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child.

You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Birth parents must register the birth of their child within 30 days of the birth, giving the child a legal identity and ensuring that the child will get certain documents, such as a birth certificate and a passport. The child must be at least seven days old before written permission for adoption can be given and the natural parents then have 21 days to change their mind and cancel the permission. If permission is cancelled within the 21 days, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the 21 days has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their mind about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents' consent.
 
How to adopt a child in Ontario
There are generally two ways to adopt a child in Ontario. The first is a public adoption through the Children's Aid Society. The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licenced by the Ontario Government.
To adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved the Society will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the adoption order is given by the court. There is no cost for parents to adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society public adoption process.
The process to adopt a child through a private agency is very similar to that of adopting a child through the Children's Aid Society. For a private adoption, you must contact a private adoption practitioner that has been approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. In addition, you will be charged a fee for the private services, which is generally between $15,000 and $25,000.
 
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, you do not need to go through the Children's Aid Society or a private adoption agency. However, you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order. An assessment by an adoption practitioner is not needed for this type of adoption, unless the judge requires it.
However, if you wish to adopt a family member who lives outside Canada, there are a number of steps you must take, including:

complete a homestudy assessment and training program,
be approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services,
apply through an Ontario agency licensed to handle adoptions in the child's home country, and
submit an application to Canadian immigration to get permission for your adopted child to move to Canada.

 
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 - Adopting a child from abroad.
 
The approval process for all adoptions
Ontario residents are required to complete two programs as part of the approval process for either a private, public or international adoption:
1) The Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) homestudy is completed by licensed social workers approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services before approving the arrangements for the adoption. The purpose of homestudy is to assess the ability of the applicants to parent an adopted child, and involves discussions with an adoption worker about the adoptive parents attitudes towards parenting as well as exploring their values and beliefs. It can include references, medical reports and other personal information.
2) The Parent Resources for Information and Development and Education (PRIDE) program is a standardized training program to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child. The curriculum involves a variety of areas such as: the importance of connections to the child's birth family and kin, and the importance of cultural and racial awareness.
For more information about adopting a child in Ontario, contact the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For legal advice and assistance, contact a lawyer.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to negligence or misdeeds by many professionals, such as doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and are usually extremely expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service ","

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practices, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service you required and the type of professional who provided it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, medical practitioners have an obligation, before administering any kind of medical treatment, to advise the patient fully of any associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has is based on the law, and the guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing full medical history to your doctor, or telling the truth about your case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible, and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out of pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for your pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession. For example, if your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. If your complaint is against an engineer, you may contact Professional Engineers Ontario.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Personal care can include decisions about many things, such as health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, but is usually included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will nor does it form part of a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
Is a Living Will enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Whether a Living Will is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
For more information about Living Wills, visit the Ministry of the Attorney General website at attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care, you should consult with a lawyer about making both a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will.

Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend. 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The kinds of things that your attorney can do depends entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney for Property that covers all of your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney for Property that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do, and when you are allowing them to do it. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future, or upon a specific occurrence, you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a ""Continuing Power of Attorney for Property"". This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, you should check with a lawyer to determine if it will have effect should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

be 18 years of age or older,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who is 18 years of age or older and mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a trust company to be your attorney for financial matters. Often people choose trust companies because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include, the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.
Drafting a Power of Attorney for Property involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer if you want to make a Power of Attorney for Property.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, at www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.

				Canada's Anti-terrorism Act, 2015 (the Act) received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015.
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
 
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have ma","

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"

It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are (1) not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders, (2) in a not-for-profit corporation, the members are prohibited from receiving any pecuniary gain, and (3) not-for-profit corporations are established for purposes other than gain for their members. The purpose for establishing the corporation is set out in the Articles of Incorporation under the section called 'objects.' A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.
Structure of Ontario not-for-profit corporations
In Ontario, not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest.
As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how the business of the corporation will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the members of the corporation.
Structure of federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, it will also be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a ""certificate of continuance"" to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit company in Canada.

Board of directors
The affairs of a not-for-profit corporation are managed by a board of at least three directors. Directors must be or become members of the corporation, must be at least 18 years of age, and cannot be an undischarged bankrupt. The people named as the first directors in the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of other people appointed or elected in their place. The directors of a not-for-profit corporation are elected by its members. In turn, the directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties and removal of officers of the corporation are governed by its by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, others may be admitted to membership by the directors.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death or resignation of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations or unincorporated associations. However, a not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the objects of the corporation as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.
Auditor and records
To properly and legally run a not-for-profit corporation, an auditor must be appointed by its members every year, and certain records must be kept. These include proper books of account and accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions of the corporation, books containing minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the head office of the corporation and are to be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
More information about forming a not-for-profit in Ontario can be found from the Ministry of the Attorney General, ServiceOntario, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario Not-for-Profit Guide.

If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what they owe you. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt, and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or, you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount you are owed is $25,000 or less or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor's assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor's assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means that you can take possession of the asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to make sure that your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business in Ontario, visit the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services.

Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				The Ontario government has established a number of rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.

Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child in Ontario, you must live in Ontario and you must be at least 18 years old. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Birth parents must register the birth of their child within 30 days of the birth, giving the child a legal identity and ensuring that the child will get certain documents, such as a birth certificate and a passport. The child must be at least seven days old before written permission for adoption can be given and the natural parents then have 21 days to change their mind and cancel the permission. If permission is cancelled within the 21 days, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the 21 days has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their mind about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents' consent.
 
How to adopt a child in Ontario
There are generally two ways to adopt a child in Ontario. The first is a public adoption through the Children's Aid Society. The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licenced by the Ontario Government.
To adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved the Society will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the adoption order is given by the court. There is no cost for parents to adopt a child through the Children's Aid Society public adoption process.
The process to adopt a child through a private agency is very similar to that of adopting a child through the Children's Aid Society. For a private adoption, you must contact a private adoption practitioner that has been approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. In addition, you will be charged a fee for the private services, which is generally between $15,000 and $25,000.
 
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, you do not need to go through the Children's Aid Society or a private adoption agency. However, you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order. An assessment by an adoption practitioner is not needed for this type of adoption, unless the judge requires it.
However, if you wish to adopt a family member who lives outside Canada, there are a number of steps you must take, including:

complete a homestudy assessment and training program,
be approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services,
apply through an Ontario agency licensed to handle adoptions in the child's home country, and
submit an application to Canadian immigration to get permission for your adopted child to move to Canada.

 
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 - Adopting a child from abroad.
 
The approval process for all adoptions
Ontario residents are required to complete two programs as part of the approval process for either a private, public or international adoption:
1) The Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) homestudy is completed by licensed social workers approved by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services before approving the arrangements for the adoption. The purpose of homestudy is to assess the ability of the applicants to parent an adopted child, and involves discussions with an adoption worker about the adoptive parents attitudes towards parenting as well as exploring their values and beliefs. It can include references, medical reports and other personal information.
2) The Parent Resources for Information and Development and Education (PRIDE) program is a standardized training program to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child. The curriculum involves a variety of areas such as: the importance of connections to the child's birth family and kin, and the importance of cultural and racial awareness.
For more information about adopting a child in Ontario, contact the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For legal advice and assistance, contact a lawyer.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Spouses, who are not married, may still qualify for spousal support if they lived together as a couple:

for at least 3 years, or
for any length of time if they were in a relationship of some permanence and had a child together.

Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses. Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses' current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses' incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
 
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations.  A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

Employment Law,What is wrongful dismissal?,606,"
				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed. However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you.

				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay.

If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.
What is 'cause' for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was 'cause', sometimes known as 'just cause'. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

What is not 'cause' for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but it is not a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee's work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.

A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes a number of rights for each spouse, including who will live in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who will make child and spousal support payments, who will have custody of children and what kinds of visitation rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on ""Marriage Contracts,"" the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if the terms of the separation agreement were ordered by a court. If you are concerned that your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the separation agreement, the agreement can be filed with the Family Responsibility Office. By doing this, your agreement can be enforced without cost to you under the Family Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act. This office is funded by the Government of Ontario and has significant powers to enforce support payment under the agreement. You can also file the agreement with the court pursuant to the Family Law Act. For more information on filing your separation agreement, refer to the Family Responsibility Office or visit your local courthouse.
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important and each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements in Ontario, refer to the Ministry of the Attorney General.

Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend. 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The kinds of things that your attorney can do depends entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney for Property that covers all of your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney for Property that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do, and when you are allowing them to do it. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future, or upon a specific occurrence, you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a ""Continuing Power of Attorney for Property"". This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, you should check with a lawyer to determine if it will have effect should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

be 18 years of age or older,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who is 18 years of age or older and mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a trust company to be your attorney for financial matters. Often people choose trust companies because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include, the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.
Drafting a Power of Attorney for Property involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer if you want to make a Power of Attorney for Property.

Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, and it ensures that your health will be in the hands of someone you have personally chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In this way, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is often similar to a Living Will.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued. Though a Living Will can be in any written form, it often forms part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and who can be appointed as an attorney. To give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

be 16 years of age or older, and
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney?
The term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

be 16 years of age or older,
be mentally competent, and
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

Above all, you should select someone who you know well, and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, you should ask the person if they are willing to be your attorney, and discuss with them your wishes and their responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly. You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by two witnesses.

The two witnesses must:

both be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
not be the attorney you are appointing, the attorney's spouse or common-law partner, your own spouse or partner, your child or any person under the age of 18.

 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. You should always consult a lawyer to prepare a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.

It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are (1) not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders, (2) in a not-for-profit corporation, the members are prohibited from receiving any pecuniary gain, and (3) not-for-profit corporations are established for purposes other than gain for their members. The purpose for establishing the corporation is set out in the Articles of Incorporation under the section called 'objects.' A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.
Structure of Ontario not-for-profit corporations
In Ontario, not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest.
As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how the business of the corporation will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the members of the corporation.
Structure of federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, it will also be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a ""certificate of continuance"" to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit company in Canada.

Board of directors
The affairs of a not-for-profit corporation are managed by a board of at least three directors. Directors must be or become members of the corporation, must be at least 18 years of age, and cannot be an undischarged bankrupt. The people named as the first directors in the Articles of Incorporation of the corporation remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of other people appointed or elected in their place. The directors of a not-for-profit corporation are elected by its members. In turn, the directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties and removal of officers of the corporation are governed by its by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, others may be admitted to membership by the directors.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death or resignation of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations or unincorporated associations. However, a not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the objects of the corporation as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.
Auditor and records
To properly and legally run a not-for-profit corporation, an auditor must be appointed by its members every year, and certain records must be kept. These include proper books of account and accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions of the corporation, books containing minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the head office of the corporation and are to be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.

If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under the Family Law Act, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, under the Children's Law Reform Act, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child's father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the Family Law Act imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The Act provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16 years of age or older if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by the Child Support Guidelines of Ontario and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights under the Children's Law Reform Act.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

Some legal services can be provided by either a lawyer or a paralegal. In other situations, you must use a lawyer.  Every lawyer and paralegal practising in Ontario must be a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada. Lawyers and paralegals who provide legal services to the public are required to carry professional liability insurance.
In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that ""signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine"". In Ontario, notaries public are governed by the Notaries Act.  A lawyer can be a notary public, but not every notary public is a lawyer.  Also, notaries public do not have to undergo special education or training.  A notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B), a Juris Doctor (JD) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society.  In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer) or, a Law Practice Program (a combination of training and work placement).
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

Paralegals
Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Paralegals must complete a legal services program approved by the Law Society as well as licensing examinations. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and minor, limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or Wills and estates. For a more complete description of what a paralegal can do, refer to topic 857 Do you need a lawyer or paralegal?
Typically, paralegals' fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers' fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits.  An affidavit is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true.  A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other oaths, affirmations or declarations inside or outside of Ontario, or subject to any limit placed upon them by the Attorney General.
In Ontario, individuals who are not lawyers who wish to become a notary public or commissioner for taking oaths, may do so by completing an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. Applicants will only be considered if their employment requires the notarizing of documents in Ontario for:

Senior government officials
Ontario registered corporations engaged in international or inter-provincial trade and/or commerce
Patent and trademark agents
Head offices of national or provincial unions engaged in out-of-province business.

Visit the Ministry of the Attorney General for more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits.
Contact the Law Society of Upper Canada if you wish to confirm that an Ontario lawyer or licensed paralegal is entitled to provide legal services. This will help you make an informed decision on whether the person you are thinking of hiring is right for you.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will is a document, or can form a part of a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date. It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover.

				A Living Will is a document, or can form a part of a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date. It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.

In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Personal care can include decisions about many things, such as health care, medical treatment, diet, housing, clothing, hygiene, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, but is usually included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will nor does it form part of a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
Is a Living Will enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Whether a Living Will is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
For more information about Living Wills, visit the Ministry of the Attorney General website at attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care, you should consult with a lawyer about making both a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will.

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

				Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of CPP benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor's estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker's spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you.  To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP)
In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017. The ORPP is intended to augment the Canada Pension Plan along with an individual’s already existing personal retirement savings, so that individuals will have a predictable source of income during retirement. The ORPP will be a provincially-managed pension plan, administered by the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation (ORPP AC), an independent pension organization.
Eligible employees will make mandatory contributions through payroll deductions. These contributions will be matched by employers' contributions.
Who will be enrolled in the ORPP?
Once the Act comes into force, every employee in Ontario will either be enrolled in the ORPP, or a comparable workplace pension plan by the year 2020.
Ontario residents who retire after making contributions would be eligible to start receiving a pension at age 65. ORPP benefit payments would begin in 2022.
 
Who will not be enrolled in the ORPP?
Not all Ontario employees and employers will be enrolled, including:

Individuals and employers who are already participating in a comparable workplace pension plan
Federal employees

According to the Ontario government, a comparable workplace pension plan is one that:

provides participants with a predictable stream of income for life;
provides some security that participants won't outlive their savings;
requires contributions from employers to ensure fairness; and
aims to replace up-to 15% of pre-retirement income.

Visit ontario.ca for more information regarding comparable workplace pension plans.
Benefit amounts under the ORPP

The benefit amount you will receive from the ORPP will depend on three factors:

How many years you have contributed to the plan,
Total contributions made to the ORPP, and
Your salary during the years you contributed.

ORPP Enrollment stages
In 2016, the ORPP AC will begin contacting all Ontario employers to confirm their existing pension plans and to evaluate the coverage that is offered to their employees.
Enrollment of employers and employees in the ORPP will occur in stages, beginning with the largest employers.
Wave 1: Large employers (500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2017.
Wave 2: Medium employers (50- 499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2018.
Wave 3: Small employers (50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2019.
Wave 4: Employers with a workplace pension plan that does not meet the criteria of a comparable workplace pension plan, as well as employees who are not members of their workplace’s comparable plan, will begin contributing to the ORPP on January 1, 2020.
Contribution rates
Contribution rates will be phased in beginning from when an employer enrolls in the ORPP. Once employees and employers begin contributing at the maximum rate, their contributions will continue at that rate. Employees and employers will each contribute as follows:

First year rate will be 0.8% of annual earnings.
Second year rate will be 1.6% of earnings.
Third year and subsequent years, contributions will be fixed at the rate of 1.9% of annual earnings up to $90,000. Earnings above $90,000 will be exempt from ORPP contributions.

 
Self-Employed and the ORPP
Currently, the federal Income Tax Act prohibits self-employed persons from being included in the ORPP.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to negligence or misdeeds by many professionals, such as doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and are usually extremely expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service ","
				Professional malpractice refers to negligence or misdeeds by many professionals, such as doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and are usually extremely expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must be able to prove that they failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practices, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service you required and the type of professional who provided it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, medical practitioners have an obligation, before administering any kind of medical treatment, to advise the patient fully of any associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has is based on the law, and the guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing full medical history to your doctor, or telling the truth about your case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible, and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out of pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for your pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession. For example, if your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. If your complaint is against an engineer, you may contact Professional Engineers Ontario.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

To be eligible for disability benefits, you must complete the application process, which includes medical examinations.
Under the Ontario Disability Support Program, the amount you receive depends on your living arrangement.  It is made up of two portions: Income Support and Employment Support.
Income Support is meant to supplement other income. The basic needs portion of Income Support is meant to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and other necessary personal items. The amount you receive is based on a number of factors, including the number of people in your family and the age of your family members, where you live and how much you pay to live there, and your income and any assets you may have. The shelter allowance portion of the Income Support is meant to help cover such things as: rent or your mortgage payments, heat and utilities;  and is based on your actual shelter costs up to a maximum depending on the number of people in your family. Those who qualify for Income Support may also be eligible for other benefits such as drug and dental coverage, vision care, help with transportation costs, and wheelchair/mobility devise repairs and batteries.
Employment Support is also provided and helps people with disabilities, who can and want to work, prepare for and find a job.
To apply for benefits, call the nearest Ontario Disability Support Program office. Applications are also available online, or at your local ODSP office. It can take from a few weeks up to a few months to find out if you qualify for disability benefits. In the meantime, if you need help right away to pay for food, housing and other living costs, you can apply for financial assistance under Ontario Works. If you qualify, Ontario Works will be able to help you right away. They can also help you apply for Ontario Disability Support Program Income Support.

Aboriginal and treaty rights belonging to the Aboriginal people of Canada are collective rights, protected under Section 35 of the Constitution,
Section 35 states:
“(1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.
(2) In this Act, ""Aboriginal Peoples of Canada"" includes the Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.
(3) For greater certainty, in subsection (1) ""treaty rights"" includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female persons.”
For example, if the government enacts a law that prevents Aboriginal people from carrying on a certain activity or practice that is integral and distinctive to their culture, such as hunting or fishing in a particular area, they may bring a court action against the government, on the grounds that the law infringes on Aboriginal or treaty rights.
Aboriginal rights
The Supreme Court of Canada, in the case of R. v. Van der Peet determined that an activity or practice is an Aboriginal right if it was an “element of a practice, custom or tradition integral to the distinctive culture of the Aboriginal group claiming the right”. In this case, the appellant, Dorothy Van der Peet, was charged with the offence of selling fish that was caught under an Indian food fish license. She argued that selling fish was an Aboriginal right. The Court found that exchanging fish for money or other goods was not a central and defining feature of the appellant’s society.
In this decision, the Court gave guidance on what constitutes an Aboriginal right. The practice must:

be of central significance to the group,
have existed prior to the arrival of Europeans in North America (not merely before Crown sovereignty), and
have continued to the present day.

In addition, the practice must be shown to be distinctive. To show that the practice is distinctive, or a distinctive part of that culture, the claimant must show that “this tradition or custom makes the culture what it is, not that the practice, custom or tradition is different from the practices, customs or traditions of another culture.”  For example, in a previous case, R.v.Sparrow, about the Musqueam right to fish for food, the activity of fishing for food is clearly common to many people. However, fishing for food made the Musqueam culture what it is, and is therefore a distinctive part of that culture.
Treaty rights
Treaty rights are rights specific to the individual treaties that were negotiated between the Crown (the Canadian Government) and the Aboriginal groups. There were many treaties made between Canada and the Aboriginals.
Many of the treaties indicate that the Aboriginals surrendered their title to large tracts of land, in exchange for:

reserves,
monetary payments,
rights to hunt and fish off the reserve,
health care, and
education benefits.

These treaties were numbered, so they are often referred to as numbered treaties. Many of these provided for hunting and fishing rights on the surrendered lands. However, these rights are subject to regulations and the taking up of the lands for settlement or other reasons.

				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.

				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life.

As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfils the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The ""guarantee period"" may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed-term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. The funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or their agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first and then purchase a structured settlement annuity yourself after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements, you should consult a lawyer.

There are four ways to change your name.  First, you can assume your spouse's surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.  Second, you can legally change your surname based on marital status by completing an Election to Change Surname form. The right to change one's surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
Third, you can change your entire name for any other reason by completing An Application to Change an Adult's Name.  Last, you can apply to change your child's name by completing An Application to Change a Child's Name.  Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
The law governing name changes is the Change of Name Act.  All change of name applications are submitted to the Registrar General's office at:
Office of the Registrar General
PO Box 3000
189 Red River Road
Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5W0
Assuming your spouse's surname upon marriage and resuming your former surname upon divorce or death of spouse
When you get married, you can change your last name by assuming your spouse's last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name). To use this assumed name you do not need to make an application.
By using your government issued marriage certificate, and other government documents to prove your identity, Canadian citizenship and that you are an Ontario resident, you can obtain a new dirver's licence and health card. There is no cost to complete this type of surname change. Once you have a driver's licence with your new assumed surname, you will be able to use your assumed name on your bank accounts and conduct other business under this new name. This type of name change will not change the surname on your birth certificate.
If you get a divorce or annulment, or upon the death of your spouse, you may once again resume using the surname you had immediately prior to your marriage.  Because you assumed your spouse's surname and did not formally change your surname, you do not need to complete a formal application to resume using your previous name. In order to change your surname on government documents, such as a driver's licence, you will need to show your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate) together with documents (such as a birth certificate) showing the name you want to resume using.
 
Legally changing your last name upon marriage:
Election to Change Surname form
Upon marriage, in addition to the right to assume your spouse's surname, you have the right to legally change your last name to your spouse’s last name (or combine both of your last names into a hyphenated last name) by completing the Election to Change Surname form. Unlike assuming your spouse's surname, this type of name change will appear on your Ontario birth certificate. You may also change your last name while you are living with a person in a conjugal relationship outside marriage. This applies to both opposite sex or same couples.
To legally change your last name upon marriage, you will need to complete the Election to Change Surname form, which applies to both those who are legally married and to those living in a common-law relationship.  There is no fee to submit this type of application provided you do so within 90 days of being married or of filing a joint declaration of conjugal relationship. After 90 days, the fee is $25. This form is only obtainable by calling 1-800-461-2156. In addition to completing this form, you will need to provide:

Your marriage certificate, or if living common-law, a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form
Birth Certificate(s)
Change of Name Certificate(s) (if applicable)
Police records check (if applicable)

After your application is processed you will receive a letter confirming the change.  You will then need to order a new Ontario birth certificate, which will show your new name as well as your previous name.  You will also be able to obtain other Ontario government issued documents, such as a driver's licence and health card, which will show your new surname.
 
Legally change your last name after divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse:
Election to Resume Former Surname form
After a marriage is dissolved by either a divorce, annulment or the death of your spouse, you may resume using the surname you had immediately before marriage.  If you legally changed your last name to that of your spouse by completing the Election to Change Surname form (as opposed to simply assuming your spouse's surname), then you will need to complete the Election to Resume Former Surname form.
In addition to the form, you will need to submit a copy of your divorce papers (or spouse's death certificate), your change of name certificate, and your birth certificate, and submit these together with the $25 fee. This form can only be obtained by calling the Registrar General's office at 1-800-461-2156. Once the change has been completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.
It is important to know that the Election to Resume Former Surname application must be submitted within 90 days of the dissolution of your marriage, otherwise, you will be required to file a formal name change using the Application to Change an Adult's Name form, which is a longer application process.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage:
Application to Change an Adult's Name
The Application to Change an Adult's Name is used to change your name for other than martial reasons. With this type of application you can change all of your names, as opposed to only your surname. The fee is $137. This type of name change will change the name on your Ontario birth certificate. The form is available online at ontario.ca
To change your name for a reason other than marriage, you must be:•

16 years of age or older, and
have lived in Ontario for at least one year before submitting the application.

In addition to completing the form, you will be required to submit other documents such as:

if born in Canada, original birth certificate (or certified copy),
copy of marriage certificate (if you are currently married) or a Joint Declaration of Conjugal Relationship form (if you are living common-law)
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If you are 16 or 17 years old, and you are married, you can complete this application without the consent of your parents or guardian.  You will, however, need to submit proof of your marriage. If you are 16 or 17 years old and not married, you will need to obtain permission from your parents, guardians or anyone who has legal custody of you before you can change your name.
Once the name change is completed, you will receive a Change of Name Certificate.

Changing a child’s last name
If you want to change the name of a child who is 17 years of age or younger and has lived in Ontario for at least the past 12 months, you must submit an Application to Change a Child's Name.  You must have legal custody of the child, and the child must be unmarried.  As with the adult application, this form can be obtained online at ontario.ca.  The fee to change a child's name is $22 for each child if they change their names at the same time as one of their parents.
In addition to the application form and the fee, you will need to submit other documents, such as:

birth certificate (or certified copy),
if born outside Canada, proof of Canadian citizenship
copy of name change certificates (if applicable)
court certified copies of court orders, and police records check (if applicable)

The application form, the fee, and the supporting documents must then be submitted to the Registrar General's office.
If a child 16 or 17 years old would like to change their name on their own, they can do so if they are married, or if unmarried, as long as they have the written consent of their parents, legal guardian, or anyone who has legal custody of them. In either case, they need to use the Application to Change an Adult's Name and pay the $137 fee.
For more information on changing your name, you can call the Office of the Registrar General in Toronto at 416-325-8305 or toll-free 1-800-461-2156. Or visit ontario.ca.

Other purposes beneficial to the community.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations
Public foundations
Private foundations

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public's perspective.
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency, or the Government of Canada's - Canada Business Ontario guide on charitable status.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

What is Aboriginal title to land?
The Court has determined that Aboriginal title is a collective right of an Aboriginal group, which provides a beneficial interest in the land.
Aboriginal title gives the Aboriginal group the right to:

exclusive use and occupation of the land, including for non-traditional purposes,
enjoy or occupy the land,

What is Aboriginal title to land?
The Court has determined that Aboriginal title is a collective right of an Aboriginal group, which provides a beneficial interest in the land.
Aboriginal title gives the Aboriginal group the right to:

exclusive use and occupation of the land, including for non-traditional purposes,
enjoy or occupy the land,
possess the land, and
reap economic benefits of the land.

It is important to note however, that Aboriginal title is not the same as fee simple ownership, which is complete ownership with no limitations or restrictions. Aboriginal title is unique and comes with limitations and conditions. For example, as it is a collective title, the land must be used in a way such that future generations can continue to use and enjoy it. Further, the land cannot be sold, and title cannot be transferred.
How is Aboriginal title established?
In 2014, the Supreme Court dealt with the issue of Aboriginal title in the case of Tsilhq’ot v. British Columbia. The Court determined that the legal test for Aboriginal title was properly set out in the prior case of R. v. Delgamuukw.
As a result of these two cases, the general requirements for Aboriginal title are:
(i)   sufficient occupation of the land claimed to establish title at the time of assertion of European sovereignty;
(ii)  continuity of occupation where present occupation is relied on; and
(iii) exclusive historic occupation.
Sufficient Occupation: The Court held that the meaning of what constitutes sufficient occupation must be approached in a culturally sensitive way. It is to be interpreted with consideration for both common law and Aboriginal perspectives. To establish sufficiency, the group must show evidence of a “strong presence on or over the land claimed, manifesting itself in acts of occupation that could reasonably be interpreted as demonstrating that the land in question belonged to, was controlled by, or was under the exclusive stewardship of the claimant group”. For example, sufficient occupation would exist where the land was being cultivated and houses had been built on it. Further, the Court held that title should not be narrowly restricted to specific village sites and farms, but rather, should include lands where the group regularly hunts, fishes or traps.
Continuity: As for continuity of possession, the Court held that it is unnecessary to prove an unbroken chain of continuity. Rather, the group must provide evidence that the present occupation is “rooted in (the past) to pre-sovereignty times”.
Exclusivity: Exclusivity was determined to mean the “intention and capacity to retain exclusive control” over the lands. Evidence of exclusivity should be considered from both a common law and Aboriginal perspective. For example, although proof that others were excluded from the land does show exclusivity, permission given to other groups to use the land, will not necessarily negate exclusivity. In addition, the existence of treaties that grant permission to other groups to enter the land also serves to establish exclusivity to the group granting the permission.
Use or development of Aboriginal lands by non-Aboriginal groups
Where non-Aboriginal groups seek to use the land under Aboriginal title, consent must be sought from the titleholders.
If consent is not given, and the government wishes to develop the land for public good, it may seek the court’s permission on the grounds of justification under s.35 of the Constitution Act. It is important to note that regardless of whether title is established or unproven, the Crown has a duty to consult with the Aboriginal group.
Where title is proven, however, the Crown must not only consult with the group, but also provide a compelling and substantive objective to the governmental action in question. The Court in R.v. Delgamuukw provided examples of what may be valid justifications for infringing Aboriginal title, including:

development of agriculture, forestry, mining, and hydroelectric power,
protection of the environment or an endangered species,
the building of infrastructure, and
the settlement of foreign populations to accomplish any of the above.

“Bands” are communities that are governed under the Indian Act.
“First Nations” refers to the communities or nations of indigenous peoples in Canada who used to be called “Indians”. One nation can be made up of several bands. For example, the Tsilhqot’in Nation is made up of six bands.
“Inuit” refers to the Aboriginal people of Arctic Canada.
“Métis” are people descended from mixed ancestry of First Nations and European ancestry who formed distinct communities. There is currently a case in the court, Canada v. Daniels, which deals with whether non-status Indians and Métis are included as “Indians” for the purpose of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The case is pending appeal at the Supreme Court of Canada.
“Registered or Status Indian”: an Aboriginal person may be a “registered” or “status” Indian if they meet the criteria provided in the Indian Act. Having status entitles the person to certain programs and services from the government.
Bands under the Indian Act
Some First Nation communities are governed under the Indian Act. These communities are referred to as “bands”. Each band has a Chief and a Council.
Under the Act, a nation is a “band” if it has a reserve, or if it has a trust fund held by the government for its benefit; or if it has been declared by the Governor General acting on the advice of the Cabinet.
Specifically, the Indian Act defines a “band” as follows:
“band” means a body of Indians
(a) for whose use and benefit in common, lands, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, have been set apart before, on or after September 4, 1951,
(b) for whose use and benefit in common, moneys are held by Her Majesty, or
(c) declared by the Governor in Council to be a band for the purposes of this Act.
Various types of government funding and land are provided for the benefit and use of the bands. However, the bands and their members cannot own the land.
There are many First Nation communities that are not governed under the Act. These nations are “self-governing”. For example, in the Yukon, only three of the eleven First Nations remain under the Indian Act. Where the nation is self-governing, the members are referred to as “citizens”. Each self-governing nation has its own constitution and owns and manages its land.
Membership in a Band
To become a member of a band, a person must:

be a registered or status Indian under the Indian Act, and
be accepted as a member by the band.

Registered or Status Indian
Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada states that a person is entitled to be registered under the Indian Act, if they qualify under one of the following categories:

People who were entitled to be registered prior to April 17, 1985,
Women who lost their status as a result of marrying a man who was not a status Indian,
Children of women who were entitled to be registered prior to April 17, 1985, who were enfranchised upon their mother's marriage,
Children whose mother and whose father's mother did not have status under the Act before their marriage, and who lost their status at the age of 21 (s.12 (1)(a)(iv) – referred to commonly as the double-mother rule),
Illegitimate children, whose registration was successfully protested on the grounds that their father did not have status under the Act, however their mother did have status,
A person who lost registration because their parents (or head of the household) applied to give up registration and First Nation membership through the process known as ""enfranchisement"" (s. 109(1) or its predecessor section),
Children of people listed in 1 to 6 above,
Illegitimate daughters of status Indian men and women without status, born before April 17, 1985.

Application forms for registration under the Indian Act are available online, at Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada.

Acceptance by a Nation or a Band
Section 10 of the Indian Act allows bands to control membership. This means that even if you are a registered Indian, that does not automatically mean you are a member of your First Nation. Each nation has its own criteria for membership. Conversely, this also means that a person can become a citizen of a First Nation while not being a registered Indian.
Benefits of having Indian Status and Band or Nation membership
A registered Indian is eligible for many programs and services. These include:
1. Treaty Annuity payments. These are annual payments made by the federal government to registered Indians who are entitled to these payments through membership to bands that have signed historic treaties with the Crown.
2. Social Programs

Income Assistance Program
National Child Benefit Reinvestment
Assisted Living Program
First Nations Child and Family Services Program
Family Violence Prevention Program

3. Band Employee Benefits
An individual’s rights to the programs can vary depending on whether the person is a registered Indian and/or a citizen of a Nation.

There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
 
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.
 
How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.
 
Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.
 
Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada's Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

“A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:
(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.”
The Youth Criminal Justice Act carries a similar provision under s.38.(1)(d).
In 1999, section 718.2(e) was first challenged by Jamie Gladue, an Aboriginal woman, in the Supreme Court of Canada case, R.v.Gladue. This case brought to light the fact that there is an over representation of Aboriginal people in Canada’s criminal justice system.
The Court concluded that a lack of understanding of Aboriginal people lead to systematic racism. The unbalanced ratio of imprisonment rates flow from many factors such as:

the generational effects of colonization and displacement
the impact of residential schools
the loss of cultural identity

The Canadian justice system recognized that Canada’s Aboriginal peoples have been marginalized significantly resulting in communities left impoverished and disadvantaged. The Court held that judges should consider the unique circumstances surrounding the offence and parties to the offence, and take into account the unique factors in relation to Aboriginal people. These factors are referred to as the Gladue Principles:
(A) The unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular Aboriginal offender before the courts; and
(B) The types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular Aboriginal heritage or connection.
The Court also stated that sentencing Aboriginal offenders to jail is often inappropriate, given their difference in background, which reduces the likelihood of rehabilitation, and the discrimination that exists in penal institutions.
How Gladue applies in Canadian courts
Every criminal court in Canada is required to take Gladue factors and principles into consideration when sentencing an Aboriginal person. Courts in Ontario are also required to take a person’s Aboriginal background and the Gladue principles into account at bail hearings, and a Gladue report is created for the court to consider prior to sentencing.
In addition, there are specialized courts, called Gladue courts, where the legal professionals who work there, such as Crown Counsel, Duty Counsel, and Probation and Parole Officers, have expertise in Aboriginal programs and services. For more information on Gladue courts and practices, please see the Department of Justice Canada’s publication, Gladue Practices in the Provinces and Territories.
Aboriginal people should self-identify as First Nations, Métis or Inuit
When Aboriginal persons are charged with a crime, it is important that they tell their legal advisor, and/or those in the criminal justice system (duty counsel, crown etc.) of their Aboriginal ancestry. This applies to both those living on and off reserve, as well as people who are status and non-status.
It is important that people identify themselves as Aboriginal persons so that their legal counsel can better help them. There are laws, including in the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and provincial Family Services Acts, which take the unique Aboriginal heritage into consideration.
Sentencing alternatives
By applying section 718.2(e) to cases that come before the courts, Aboriginal people found guilty of less serious crimes have the option to receive punishments that are more likely to result in rehabilitation and which are more culturally appropriate. For example, a sentencing alternative, such as diversion, may be applied. Diversion is a negotiated resolution. After charges are laid, the offender is given the chance to participate in the program, which could require the offender to donate to a charity, write a letter of apology or perform community service. Once the program is completed, the offender’s charge is dismissed. First Nations have diversion programs for minor offences.
Policing of Aboriginal communities
First Nations Policing Program (FNPP)
Under the FNPP, Aboriginal communities have agreements with the federal and provincial/territorial governments regarding police services. Through the FNPP, there are two types of policing agreements:
1.  Where an Aboriginal community manages its own services, in accordance with provincial policing laws and regulations;
For example: in British Columbia the Stl’atl’imx (Stat-la-mic) Tribal Police Service is a First Nations administered police force with a police board comprised of community members; in Ontario, there are First Nations Constables, who are appointed by the Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and approved by the Aboriginal community. For more information, please see OPP’s publication, First Nation Policing in Ontario,
and
2.  Where a dedicated group of police officers within an existing police force (usually the RCMP) provides policing services to an Aboriginal community.
The FNPP is funded by both the federal and provincial/territorial governments, and is administered by the Aboriginal Policing Directorate. The Directorate has many duties, including:

providing policy advice on Aboriginal public safety and justice issues
conducting research and reporting about the performance of the FNPP
acting as the departmental lead on Aboriginal self-governance as it relates to the administration of justice.

Some bands have their own “band constables” who do not have official police status. These constables enforce First Nations by-laws.
There are a number of organizations and programs that provide legal assistance for Aboriginal people throughout Canada. For more information visit the Related Links section of this website.

Aboriginal offenders & Gladue Principles
In 1996, the Criminal Code was amended so that offenders should not be jailed (deprived of liberty) if less restrictive measures were appropriate. The law includes special considerations for Aboriginal offenders. Section 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code provides:
“A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:
(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.”
The Youth Criminal Justice Act carries a similar provision under s.38.(1)(d).
In 1999, section 718.2(e) was first challenged by Jamie Gladue, an Aboriginal woman, in the Supreme Court of Canada case, R.v.Gladue. This case brought to light the fact that there is an over representation of Aboriginal people in Canada’s criminal justice system.
The Court concluded that a lack of understanding of Aboriginal people lead to systematic racism. The unbalanced ratio of imprisonment rates flow from many factors such as:

the generational effects of colonization and displacement
the impact of residential schools
the loss of cultural identity

The Canadian justice system recognized that Canada’s Aboriginal peoples have been marginalized significantly resulting in communities left impoverished and disadvantaged. The Court held that judges should consider the unique circumstances surrounding the offence and parties to the offence, and take into account the unique factors in relation to Aboriginal people. These factors are referred to as the Gladue Principles:
(A) The unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular Aboriginal offender before the courts; and
(B) The types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular Aboriginal heritage or connection.
The Court also stated that sentencing Aboriginal offenders to jail is often inappropriate, given their difference in background, which reduces the likelihood of rehabilitation, and the discrimination that exists in penal institutions.

Indian Act exemptions
Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals pay the same taxes for personal and real property off-reserve. However, for Status Indians, section 87 of the Indian Act (the ‘Act’) provides tax exemptions from taxes on personal and real property if the property is on a reserve. Personal property includes goods, services and income. This tax exemption has been in existence since before Confederation. The purpose of the exemption is to help preserve reserve lands and property on reserves, and to ensure that the use of property on reserves is not eroded by taxes.

Indian Act exemptions
Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals pay the same taxes for personal and real property off-reserve. However, for Status Indians, section 87 of the Indian Act (the ‘Act’) provides tax exemptions from taxes on personal and real property if the property is on a reserve. Personal property includes goods, services and income. This tax exemption has been in existence since before Confederation. The purpose of the exemption is to help preserve reserve lands and property on reserves, and to ensure that the use of property on reserves is not eroded by taxes.
Under the Act, an Indian is defined as “a person who pursuant to this Act is registered as an Indian or is entitled to be registered as an Indian”. The Act specifies the requirements for determining who is considered an Indian under the Act, and it sets out three classifications of Indians, Status Indian, non-Status Indian, and Treaty Indian.
Status Indian: a person who is registered as an Indian under the Act.
Non-Status Indian: a person who is not registered as an Indian under the Act, who lost their status or whose ancestors were never registered, or lost their status under current or former provisions of the Act.
Treaty Indian: is a Status Indian who belongs to a First Nation that signed a treaty with the Crown, and is, therefore, entitled to treaty benefits.
Income tax
The Supreme Court of Canada has determined that whether the income of a Status Indian is tax exempt depends on a number of “connecting factors”. In deciding whether an employee’s wages were to be taxed, the Court considered the location:

where the work was performed,
of the head office of the employer,
of the employee’s residence, and
where the wages were paid.

Generally, if the income is connected to a reserve, then the income is tax exempt. The “connecting factors” test applies to individuals and unincorporated businesses. If the income is earned off-reserve by a Status Indian, it will also be considered tax exempt as long as the employer is located on a reserve.
Employment-related income, such as Employment Insurance and Canada Pension Plan benefits will also be tax exempt if the income giving rise to these benefits qualifies for exemption.
Scholarships and bursaries
Scholarships and other types of education allowances are tax exempt for Status Indians.
OAS and GIS
Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) payments are paid by the government. These payments are available to all Canadians, are not connected to previous employment income, and are not connected to reserves. Consequently, these payments are not tax exempt regardless of whether the recipient lives on reserve.
Investment income
Investment income may be tax exempt if the income was earned on an investment made at a financial institution located on a reserve.
GST and HST
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) do not usually apply if the purchase of goods or services was made on a reserve, or if the goods purchased were delivered to a reserve by the seller.

Aboriginal Law,Economic development on First Nation lands,0659,"
				The following information is currently under review.
Although First Nations businesses are interested in the development of transactions with people both on and off reserve, there continues to be a great deal of misunderstanding about accessibility of reserves by non-First Nation groups. Consequently, non-First Nation businesses may be reluctant to enter into relationships where the laws are not clear to them. In many cases, the rules set out in the Indian Act (Act) apply. However, other rules may also apply, such as in communities which have self-government agreements in place. It is prudent that before entering into agreements, legal advice should be obtained.

However, other rules may also apply, such as in communities which have self-government agreements in place. It is prudent that before entering into agreements, legal advice should be obtained.
 
Third party access rights
1.  The law of trespass
There are two general exceptions to the law of trespass on reserves, one is for police purposes and the second is in cases of expropriation of land by the government. These exceptions do not normally apply to non-First Nation groups wishing to enter a reserve to do business. In such cases, the Act provides laws that deal with trespassing on reserve lands by non-First Nations. Although what trespassing is has not been clearly defined, it definitely includes entering upon someone’s land without lawful authority. For example:

a First Nations council would be permitted to refuse entry to unallocated lands (where no one member holds a certificate to that land) on a reserve, and


an individual band member, who is in lawful possession or holds custom allotments (granted by First Nations council) can refuse entry to that land.

By contrast, an individual band member, who holds a certificate of possession, does not have the legal right to refuse access to that land. Essentially, anyone who trespasses on a reserve is guilty of a summary offence. The Act does not allow First Nations council to define what trespass is, or for example, to grant a system of permits for entry (which would essentially be defining trespass). However, the Act does allow First Nations councils to create by-laws, which set out the punishment and removal of people who were found to have trespassed on reserve land, or be frequenting the reserve for prohibited purposes. The Act ensures that the common law remedies for trespass are maintained, and a First Nations band, an individual band member, and/or the Crown (federal government) can bring an action in trespass.
 
2.  Business and trespass: seizure limitations
The Act has provisions which protect First Nations personal property and lands (real property) from seizure:

Section 89 (1) of the Act states that the real and personal property of a First Nation or a band which is on reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour or at the instance of any person other than a First Nation or a band.


Section 29 of the Act states that, “Reserve lands are not subject to seizure under legal process.”

These sections of the Act mean that a non-First Nation lender does not have the right to enter a reserve for the purpose of seizing and selling property that is located on reserve, in the case where the borrower has defaulted in making payments on the loan. In addition, garnishment laws do not apply on reserve. For example, a non-First Nation cannot garnish the personal property of a First Nation individual or band that is on reserve. These laws make it more difficult for on reserve businesses and individuals to secure loans from banks and other traditional lenders.
 
Accessing reserve lands and/or enforcing security
Although the Act can be a barrier to business non-First Nation entities, there are a number of ways that non-First Nation businesses can access reserves to do business and to collect security in order to enforce business agreements.
Six exceptions to Section 89 (1):
1.  Designated leased lands
The Act allows First Nation bands to designate lands, which can be leased. Under section 89 (1.1) “a leasehold interest in designated lands is subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress and execution.” This means that a lender could legally enter on to a reserve, take possession of the property with the mortgaged leasehold interest and operate the business, or sell their interest in the project.
The designation can specify what the land will be used for, or be general in nature. Unfortunately, business opportunities have been lost because designation can be a lengthy process.
2.  Permits
General:  Under section 28 (1) of the Act, permits can be issued which allow the use of reserve land for activities such as grazing or timber removal.
Small-scale use:  Also, under section 28 (2) permits can be issued which authorize the possession of reserve lands by non-First Nation for small-scale use. Although these types of permits are inexpensive and common, they do have their limitations. For example, the permits are usually only for a maximum of one year and are not transferrable. These two issues can make it difficult to get financing based on the value of the permit.

Unused land:  Where reserve land is not being used, under section 58 (1), after getting consent from the band council, the Minister can issue permits for the lease of the land. In such cases, the land must be used for agricultural or grazing purposes, or for any purpose that is for the benefit of the person in possession of the land, or if not under lawful possession of an individual member, then for the benefit of the band.
Lease without the land being designated:  Under section 58 (3), on application of a First Nation member who is in lawful possession of land, the Minister may lease the land for the benefit of the member, without the land being designated. This means that the member’s right to possession can be leased to a non-First Nation for the purpose of financing and development. Although the Act does not require consent of the council for the member to lease the land, it is common practice that the member obtains council support, as the land is still part of the reserve.
3.  Conditional sales contract
If an item is sold subject to a conditional sales contract, section 89 (2) allows the seller the right to recover the property if the buyer defaults in the payments. If a court order is obtained, the seller can have a sheriff enter on to a reserve and collect the property in question.
In addition, if the sales contract was with a First Nation, rather than an individual band member, there would likely also be a resolution by the council approving the transaction. This resolution would be further documentation that a lending institution could rely on in making its decision to provide the loan.
 
4.  Corporations
The courts have determined that corporations are not considered to be “Indian” or “band” under the law. As a result, corporations, notwithstanding that the shareholders are First Nations, are not entitled to the protection from seizure and sale found in the Act.
 
5.  Waiver of section 89 rights
If First Nation members waive their rights under section 89, then section 89 will not apply to that agreement (or transaction). This means that First Nation members can contract outside of section 89, and non-First Nation businesses can rely on standard loan enforcement procedures.
 
 6.  Joint lenders
Section 89 of the Act applies only to non-First Nation. This means that one First Nation member could use standard enforcement measures of seizure and sale of secured property against another First Nation member to enforce a business agreement. As a result, by arranging a joint loan, where the lenders are a First Nation member and a non-First Nation, the lenders will not be subject to the limitations of section 89 of the Act. Often, large financial institutions, such as banks, have a First Nation member who is an employee of the bank to act as a joint lender with the bank.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as 'offer and acceptance'. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.

Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.

When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation - a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake - where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence - when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity - those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.

Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.

 
How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, in Ontario, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in the Consumer Protection Act and the Sale of Goods Act. In an attempt to protect consumers, these Acts set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, the Employment Standards Act applies. The provisions of the Act contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected. See topic 240 Employment contracts in this section of Legal Line for more information.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

				If parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, the other parent is usually responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children.

Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of eighteen. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent's rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of 18 if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a ""father"" for the purposes of paying child support.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government  family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments and is based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the Ontario or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Ontario Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Ontario, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

As mentioned, the type of parenting arrangement, for example whether there is split, sole or joint custody, also affects the amount of child support paid.
The rules determining income can be complex but usually are calculated on a spouse's total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use these guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the 1997 Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997 is neither deducted from the payer's income nor added to the recipient's income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997 these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don't want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement, for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.
More information is also available from the federal Department of Justice.

If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what they owe you. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt, and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or, you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount you are owed is $25,000 or less or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor's assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor's assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means that you can take possession of the asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to make sure that your business does not experience cash flow problems.

				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone.

In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say.","
				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult - posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone's email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion) – sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

How can you prevent cyberbullying?
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims' limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.
 
Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia's Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario's Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it,
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

 
Specifically, Ontario's Education Act states the following:
“bullying” means aggressive and typically repeated behaviour by a pupil where,
(a) the behaviour is intended by the pupil to have the effect of, or the pupil ought to know that the behaviour would be likely to have the effect of,
(i) causing harm, fear or distress to another individual, including physical, psychological, social or academic harm, harm to the individual’s reputation or harm to the individual’s property, or
(ii) creating a negative environment at a school for another individual, and
(b) the behaviour occurs in a context where there is a real or perceived power imbalance between the pupil and the individual based on factors such as size, strength, age, intelligence, peer group power, economic status, social status, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, family circumstances, gender, gender identity, gender expression, race, disability or the receipt of special education; (intimidation)""
 
In addition, the Education Act also provides a definition of cyberbullying:
""For the purposes of the definition of “bullying” in subsection (1), bullying includes bullying by electronic means (commonly known as cyber-bullying), including,
(a) creating a web page or a blog in which the creator assumes the identity of another person;
(b) impersonating another person as the author of content or messages posted on the internet; and
(c) communicating material electronically to more than one individual or posting material on a website that may be accessed by one or more individuals.""
The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP's Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

They may be formally notified of the lawsuit by mail, or they may just read about it in the newspaper.
Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or 'certified' by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant's costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.
