Business Law,Collecting debts,230,"
				Sometimes a business is owed money either by an individual or by another business. The person or business that owes you money is called a debtor and you are called the creditor. If you have trouble getting the money you are owed, there are several steps you should follow.
Contact the debtor
First, always telephone or contact the debtor in person. The debtor may only need a friendly reminder of the money owed so you should always try to be on good terms with the people you do business with. If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what is owed. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering","

If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what is owed. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount is within the limits of your province. Or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort, and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor’s assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor’s assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means you can take possession of the asset, sell it and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to ensure your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business, contact your local government. For legal advice, consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Common-law relationships,121,"
				When two people live together in a conjugal relationship and are not married, they may be considered to be living in a common-law relationship. If you are living in a common-law relationship, you will have a number of rights and obligations arising under family law, tax law, welfare and family benefits, and employee benefit plans. Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.

Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

Family Law,Child support,117,"
				While courts in each province have the power to make orders for child support, if parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, usually the other parent is responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.

The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.

If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.
For more information or to apply for benefits, contact your local government office.
 
Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

				Many people change their name when they get married, as well as for other personal or professional reasons. Each province and territory has different procedures involving changing a person’s name, depending on their age and the circumstances under which they want it changed.
Generally, there are four ways to change your name:

You can assume your spouse’s surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.
You can legally change your surname based on marital status. The right to change one’s surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.

You can legally change your surname based on marital status. The right to change one’s surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.
You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.
To find out the rules and steps to change your name, visit your provincial government Vital Statistics office.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations,
Public foundations, and
Private foundations.

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
 
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public’s perspective.
 
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available.

CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada’s Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, visit CBSA.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Regional Business Service Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

			If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),What is a structured settlement?,486,"
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For","
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
 
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfills the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable, and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The “guarantee period” may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. Funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or his or her agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first, and then purchase a structured settlement annuity after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed, leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements you should consult a lawyer.

Types of charities
In Canada, there are four “heads” or categories of charities:

Relief of poverty
Advancement of education
Advancement of religion
Other purposes beneficial to the community

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.

In Canada, there are four “heads” or categories of charities:

Other purposes beneficial to the community

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations,
Public foundations, and
Private foundations.

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
 
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public’s perspective.
 
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Nova Scotia Collection Agencies Act
Nunavut Consumer Protection Act
Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.
For the legislation regarding what collections agencies can and cannot do in your province or territory, visit Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of Consumer Affairs.
If you require legal help, contact a lawyer.

Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Property?,157,"
				 
A Power of Attorney for Property (or Finances) is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills. The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer.

The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.
 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The type of things your attorney can do depend entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney  that covers all your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do and when. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future or upon a specific occurrence, then you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a Continuing Power of Attorney, or Enduring Power of Attorney. This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, check with a lawyer to determine if the document still applies should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property ?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. Generally, to give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

have reached the age of majority,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who has reached the age of majority and who is mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a bank or trust company. Often people choose financial institutions because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be set out in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign the Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include: the attorney you are appointing, the attorney’s spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child, or any person who  is a minor, which means under the age of majority.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. Considering that the management of your finances is at stake, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer for legal assistance.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Animals and the Law,Dog owner liability,460,"

It does not matter if the person was bitten due to the owner’s fault, negligence, or knowledge of the propensity of the dog to bite.

If a lawsuit is successful, the court can order that damages be paid to the victim, that the owner must put a muzzle or lead on the dog, or that the dog be destroyed.
Municipal by-laws throughout the country, and some provincial legislation, such as Yukon’s Dog Act and Ontario’s Dog Owners’ Liability Act, make dog owners liable for any damage caused by bites to persons or other domestic animals. In British Columbia, section 49 of its Community Charter gives specific consideration to “special powers in relation to dangerous dogs”.
In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit owning a dog for a certain time.
Currently, only the province of Ontario and the City of Winnipeg have specifically banned “pit bulls” from being bred, imported or transferred.

Business Law,Collecting debts,230,"
				Sometimes a business is owed money either by an individual or by another business. The person or business that owes you money is called a debtor and you are called the creditor. If you have trouble getting the money you are owed, there are several steps you should follow.
Contact the debtor
First, always telephone or contact the debtor in person. The debtor may only need a friendly reminder of the money owed so you should always try to be on good terms with the people you do business with. If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what is owed. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering","

Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount is within the limits of your province. Or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort, and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor’s assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor’s assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means you can take possession of the asset, sell it and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to ensure your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business, contact your local government. For legal advice, consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to","

The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on “Marriage Contracts,” the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
 
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
 
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if a court ordered the terms of the separation agreement. If you are concerned your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the agreement, file it with your provincial government. This will help enforce any schedule of payments under it. Responsibility for enforcing registered agreements in most provinces comes under the Justice or Attorney General’s ministry or department.   You can also file an agreement with the family law court in your province. Most provinces have enforcement agencies.
For example, in British Columbia, it is called the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program. In New Brunswick, it is the Family Support Orders Service. In Nova Scotia it is the Maintenance Enforcement Program; and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it is the Support Enforcement Program.
 
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important so each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements, refer to your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

				Employment Insurance (EI) is a program run by the Government of Canada to reduce the financial hardship that many experience when they lose their jobs or are unable to work. Most employees pay Employment Insurance premiums as a deduction from their pay.
There are six types of benefits available to qualifying employees.

If you lose your job through no fault of your own, you can collect regular benefits.
If you need time off during pregnancy or to care for a child, you can collect maternity or parental benefits.
If you cannot work because of sickness, you can collect sickness benefits.
Compassionate care benefits are available for those who have to take time off work temporarily, to provide care or support to a family member who is seriously ill and who has a significant risk of death within six months.
Fishing benefits are available for those self-employed in fishing, who are temporarily not earning an income from fishing.
Parents of Critically Ill Children (PCIC) benefits are available to parents who take leave from work to provide care or support to their critically ill or injured child.

 
Employment Insurance special benefits for self-employed people
Self-employed individuals also have the option to access Employment Insurance special benefits, namely:

maternity,
parental,
sickness,
compassionate care, and
benefits for parents of critically ill children.

In order to qualify, a self-employed person must first register with the Canada Employment Insurance Commission. They must also meet several criteria, including: being a Canadian citizen or permanent resident; operating his or her own business, or own more than 40% of a corporation’s voting shares, and be ineligible for regular EI benefits. A self-employed individual must wait at least 12 months from registering before qualifying for special benefits.
Self-employed Quebec residents must apply for maternity, paternity, and parental benefits through the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. All other benefits are available through the federal EI program.
There are many rules established to determine if a person is entitled to collect benefits. For more information and to access forms online, visit Employment and Social Development Canada, Service Canada.

Criminal Law,Impaired driving,773,"
				Impaired driving means being in control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is commonly referred to as drunk driving, and is a serious offence under the Canadian Criminal Code.
 
What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.

				Impaired driving means being in control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is commonly referred to as drunk driving, and is a serious offence under the Canadian Criminal Code.
 
What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?,154,"
				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch.

				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch. IX, Division IV), it is called a Mandate.
Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
 
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, thereby ensuring that your personal care will be in the hands of someone you have chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In addition, you may specify your wishes about more than health care. For example, you may have certain dietary restrictions or have determined which facility you prefer to live in should you need long-term care.
In British Columbia, the Representation Agreement Act also allows you to give your representative the authority over  the routine management of your financial affairs. In Quebec, the Mandate can contain provisions regarding both the person’s property in addition to their personal care. In Saskatchewan, although the attorney for personal care legislation applies to personal decisions, regarding such things as housing, food, and clothing, it does not apply to health care decisions, which are covered under a different Act. In New Brunswick, both a Power of Attorney for Property and a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can be included in the same document.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will or a Health Directive is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
Although the two are often confused, and, in terms of health care decisions these documents may overlap, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
For example, in Saskatchewan, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can deal with many aspects of someone’s personal care, but cannot deal with health care issues. In comparison, a Living Will sets out only wishes about your health care and not your other personal care decisions. Further, a Living Will does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf, but can simply be general instructions for future health care providers.
Although in many provinces, such as Manitoba, the government has developed a standard form that may be used, a Living Will can be in any written form. A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
To make a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

have reached the age of majority in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan; be at least 16 years of age in Ontario; and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the legislation does not state an age requirement,
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney ?
The person you give this power to may be referred to by one of the following names: attorney, agent, delegate, representative, or mandatary, depending on the province. It is important to note that the term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

have attained the age of majority (18 or 19 years of age depending on the province), except in Ontario where section 44 of the Substitute Decisions Act allows for anyone 16 years of age or older to be named as attorney,
be mentally competent,
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

In some provinces, the legislation precludes bankrupts and those with criminal records from acting as attorneys.
Above all, you should select someone you know well and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, ask that person if he or she is willing to be your attorney. Also, talk about your wishes and that person’s responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly.  You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by one or two witnesses (the number of witnesses required depends on the province).

The witnesses must:

be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
have attained the age of majority,
not be the attorney you appointed, or a spouse or common-law partner of the attorney, your own spouse or partner, your child or generally any person who is a minor.

In the province of Quebec, the Mandate must also be homologated, which means approved by the court.
 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. If it is not prepared correctly, it will not be legal. Given the importance of providing for your personal care, it is advisable to consult a lawyer when drafting a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from your provincial or territorial government.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Property?,157,"
				 
A Power of Attorney for Property (or Finances) is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills. The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer.

For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills. The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.
 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The type of things your attorney can do depend entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney  that covers all your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do and when. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future or upon a specific occurrence, then you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a Continuing Power of Attorney, or Enduring Power of Attorney. This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, check with a lawyer to determine if the document still applies should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property ?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. Generally, to give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

have reached the age of majority,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who has reached the age of majority and who is mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a bank or trust company. Often people choose financial institutions because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be set out in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign the Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include: the attorney you are appointing, the attorney’s spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child, or any person who  is a minor, which means under the age of majority.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. Considering that the management of your finances is at stake, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer for legal assistance.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.

				Was your question answered?
			An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.

				Many people change their name when they get married, as well as for other personal or professional reasons. Each province and territory has different procedures involving changing a person’s name, depending on their age and the circumstances under which they want it changed.
Generally, there are four ways to change your name:

You can assume your spouse’s surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.
You can legally change your surname based on marital status. The right to change one’s surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.

You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.
You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				Provincial governments have many rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child.

You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (including a single individual) a court believes will honour the best interests of the child. All provinces allow same-sex adoptions. If an adult (someone who has attained the age of majority) is to be adopted, there may be restrictions on who can adopt (usually, only the person or couple who tended to the individual when he or she was a minor).
 
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In most jurisdictions, consent for the adoption will be required from a child over the age of 12. In Quebec, consent is required from a child 10 years old and older.  In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Depending on the province, the child must be a certain number of days old before written permission for adoption can be given, such as seven days in Ontario and Newfoundland. In British Columbia, consent cannot be given until the baby is 10 days old. Again, depending on the province, there is also a time period in which the natural parents can change their minds and cancel the permission. For instance, in British Columbia and Quebec, a birth mother can withdraw her consent within 30 days of the child’s birth, while in Ontario, the mother has 21 days. If permission is cancelled within the prescribed period, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the period has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their minds about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents’ consent.
How to adopt a child
There are generally two common ways to adopt a child, depending on the province: public adoption and private adoption. Public adoption is through a local Children’s Aid Society, provincial Child Welfare office, or similar public agency. To adopt a child through a public agency, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved, the agency will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the court gives the adoption order.
The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licensed by a provincial government. The process is very similar to going through the public agency. Note that there are no provincial caps on adoption fees, which can range from $6,000 to $25,000.
Regardless of what province or territory they live in, generally, every potential adoptive parent must complete a homestudy, sometimes called a family assessment, conducted by a social worker through visits to the home, to make sure the adoption is suitable for the parents and the child. In most cases, the home study includes an educational component to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child.
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, in most cases, you do not need to go through a public or private adoption agency, but you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order.
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 – Adopting a child from abroad.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For more information on the adoption process and laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations,
Public foundations, and
Private foundations.

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
 
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public’s perspective.
 
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on “Marriage Contracts,” the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
 
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
 
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if a court ordered the terms of the separation agreement. If you are concerned your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the agreement, file it with your provincial government. This will help enforce any schedule of payments under it. Responsibility for enforcing registered agreements in most provinces comes under the Justice or Attorney General’s ministry or department.   You can also file an agreement with the family law court in your province. Most provinces have enforcement agencies.
For example, in British Columbia, it is called the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program. In New Brunswick, it is the Family Support Orders Service. In Nova Scotia it is the Maintenance Enforcement Program; and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it is the Support Enforcement Program.
 
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important so each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements, refer to your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.
 
				Was your question answered?
			What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on “Marriage Contracts,” the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
 
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or ‘certified’ by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant’s costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.
For more information or to apply for benefits, contact your local government office.
 
Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

Nova Scotia Collection Agencies Act
Nunavut Consumer Protection Act
Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

				While courts in each province have the power to make orders for child support, if parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, usually the other parent is responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support.

The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Business Law,Extending credit and credit checks,229,"
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver’s Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

 1. Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can claim a security or lien on a debtor’s specific asset, usually the item you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor.
A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

				Canada’s Anti-terrorism Act, 2015 (the Act) received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015.
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.

				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life.

As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
 
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfills the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable, and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The “guarantee period” may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. Funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or his or her agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first, and then purchase a structured settlement annuity after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed, leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements you should consult a lawyer.

People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements.

Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP’s Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP’s Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				Provincial governments have many rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (includi","

You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (including a single individual) a court believes will honour the best interests of the child. All provinces allow same-sex adoptions. If an adult (someone who has attained the age of majority) is to be adopted, there may be restrictions on who can adopt (usually, only the person or couple who tended to the individual when he or she was a minor).
 
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In most jurisdictions, consent for the adoption will be required from a child over the age of 12. In Quebec, consent is required from a child 10 years old and older.  In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Depending on the province, the child must be a certain number of days old before written permission for adoption can be given, such as seven days in Ontario and Newfoundland. In British Columbia, consent cannot be given until the baby is 10 days old. Again, depending on the province, there is also a time period in which the natural parents can change their minds and cancel the permission. For instance, in British Columbia and Quebec, a birth mother can withdraw her consent within 30 days of the child’s birth, while in Ontario, the mother has 21 days. If permission is cancelled within the prescribed period, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the period has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their minds about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents’ consent.
How to adopt a child
There are generally two common ways to adopt a child, depending on the province: public adoption and private adoption. Public adoption is through a local Children’s Aid Society, provincial Child Welfare office, or similar public agency. To adopt a child through a public agency, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved, the agency will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the court gives the adoption order.
The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licensed by a provincial government. The process is very similar to going through the public agency. Note that there are no provincial caps on adoption fees, which can range from $6,000 to $25,000.
Regardless of what province or territory they live in, generally, every potential adoptive parent must complete a homestudy, sometimes called a family assessment, conducted by a social worker through visits to the home, to make sure the adoption is suitable for the parents and the child. In most cases, the home study includes an educational component to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child.
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, in most cases, you do not need to go through a public or private adoption agency, but you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order.
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 – Adopting a child from abroad.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For more information on the adoption process and laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Employment Law,What is wrongful dismissal?,606,"
				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed. However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you. If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.

If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.
 
What is ’cause’ for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was ’cause’, also known as ‘just cause”. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

 
What is not ’cause’ for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but this wrong does not constitute a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee’s work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.
More information on termination of employment may also be found from your provincial or territorial Ministry of Labour.  In Quebec, visit the Standards Commission, equity, health and safety at work (CNESST).

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself.

The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations,
Public foundations, and
Private foundations.

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
 
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public’s perspective.
 
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days. Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

Internet and Cyber Law,Defamation laws (cyber-libel) and the Internet,361,"
				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.

Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;

However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts’ willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go “forum shopping”. Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under your provincial corporations act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
Although a corporation may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all provincial tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, your provincial Ministry of Finance will deny the application for dissolution. Therefore, you first must obtain proof from the Ministry of Finance that your corporation is in compliance with the tax laws and does not have any outstanding taxes. Once this is obtained, you can then proceed and your ministry or department responsible for Consumer Affairs can dissolve the corporation. You will likely need to provide copies of your Articles of Incorporation and a fee.
To obtain more information or forms of dissolution, contact your provincial Corporate Registry or visit Canada Business Network. For information on dissolving a business incorporated under the federal Canada Business Corporations Act, visit Corporations Canada.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.

Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.

What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.


Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.
You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.

				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

				Was your question answered?
			The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

Harassment is also a form of discrimination. Harassment means that the ‘harasser’ acts in an annoying or abusive manner that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the other person.
Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.

Real Estate Law,What are condominiums?,0413,"
				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				While courts in each province have the power to make orders for child support, if parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, usually the other parent is responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.

If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.

Employment Law,Employment contracts,600,"
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rule","
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For more information, you can access your provincial employment legislation, or contact your local Ministry of Labour.

Family Law,Common-law relationships,121,"

Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Business Law,Collecting debts,230,"
				Sometimes a business is owed money either by an individual or by another business. The person or business that owes you money is called a debtor and you are called the creditor. If you have trouble getting the money you are owed, there are several steps you should follow.
Contact the debtor
First, always telephone or contact the debtor in person. The debtor may only need a friendly reminder of the money owed so you should always try to be on good terms with the people you do business with. If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what is owed. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering","

If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what is owed. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount is within the limits of your province. Or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort, and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor’s assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor’s assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means you can take possession of the asset, sell it and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to ensure your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business, contact your local government. For legal advice, consult a lawyer.

NWT Consumer Protection Act
Nova Scotia Collection Agencies Act
Nunavut Consumer Protection Act
Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.

Internet and Cyber Law,Defamation laws (cyber-libel) and the Internet,361,"

Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts’ willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go “forum shopping”. Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Provincial Social Assistance and Disability Support Programs
If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.
For more information or to apply for benefits, contact your local government office.
 
Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or

The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under your provincial corporations act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
Although a corporation may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all provincial tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, your provincial Ministry of Finance will deny the application for dissolution. Therefore, you first must obtain proof from the Ministry of Finance that your corporation is in compliance with the tax laws and does not have any outstanding taxes. Once this is obtained, you can then proceed and your ministry or department responsible for Consumer Affairs can dissolve the corporation. You will likely need to provide copies of your Articles of Incorporation and a fee.

Harassment is also a form of discrimination. Harassment means that the ‘harasser’ acts in an annoying or abusive manner that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the other person.
Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.

The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days. Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

				Employment Insurance (EI) is a program run by the Government of Canada to reduce the financial hardship that many experience when they lose their jobs or are unable to work. Most employees pay Employment Insurance premiums as a deduction from their pay.
There are six types of benefits available to qualifying employees.

If you lose your job through no fault of your own, you can collect regular benefits.
If you need time off during pregnancy or to care for a child, you can collect maternity or parental benefits.
If you cannot work because of sickness, you can collect sickness benefits.
Compassionate care benefits are available for those who have to take time off work temporarily, to provide care or support to a family member who is seriously ill and who has a significant risk of death within six months.
Fishing benefits are available for those self-employed in fishing, who are temporarily not earning an income from fishing.
Parents of Critically Ill Children (PCIC) benefits are available to parents who take leave from work to provide care or support to their critically ill or injured child.

 
Employment Insurance special benefits for self-employed people
Self-employed individuals also have the option to access Employment Insurance special benefits, namely:

maternity,
parental,
sickness,
compassionate care, and
benefits for parents of critically ill children.

In order to qualify, a self-employed person must first register with the Canada Employment Insurance Commission. They must also meet several criteria, including: being a Canadian citizen or permanent resident; operating his or her own business, or own more than 40% of a corporation’s voting shares, and be ineligible for regular EI benefits. A self-employed individual must wait at least 12 months from registering before qualifying for special benefits.
Self-employed Quebec residents must apply for maternity, paternity, and parental benefits through the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. All other benefits are available through the federal EI program.
There are many rules established to determine if a person is entitled to collect benefits. For more information and to access forms online, visit Employment and Social Development Canada, Service Canada.

In British Columbia, section 49 of its Community Charter gives specific consideration to “special powers in relation to dangerous dogs”.
In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit owning a dog for a certain time.
Currently, only the province of Ontario and the City of Winnipeg have specifically banned “pit bulls” from being bred, imported or transferred.

Criminal Law,Impaired driving,773,"
				Impaired driving means being in control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is commonly referred to as drunk driving, and is a serious offence under the Canadian Criminal Code.
 
What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.

What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws.

Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rule","
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For more information, you can access your provincial employment legislation, or contact your local Ministry of Labour.

An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For more information, you can access your provincial employment legislation, or contact your local Ministry of Labour.
For legal advice about employment contract matters, consult a lawyer.

Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada’s Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, visit CBSA.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Regional Business Service Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are at least four advantages to owning a franchise.

You are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor.
For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice.
You enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor’s reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product.
It is sometimes easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.

Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
Most provinces have legislation that govern all types of franchise relationships, such as Ontario’s Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, and the New Brunswick Franchises Act. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Ontario, franchise sellers may be required to meet certain disclosure requirements and provide a full package of information on your rights and responsibilities. Visit the Canadian Franchise Association for information on legislation in your province.
There are many complicated legal issues involved in buying and operating franchises. Consult both a lawyer and an accountant when planning to enter into a franchise agreement.
For more information about franchises, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine”.
Notaries public are governed by their provincial or territorial notaries acts. Unlike lawyers and paralegals, they do not have to undergo special education or training, and a notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers may work for private law firms, legal aid, as Crown prosecutors, or in offices at the federal, provincial and municipal level of government, as well as for businesses.
Lawyers must complete years of university education and practical training. Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society. In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer). They are governed by their provincial Law Society which establishes and enforces standards of conduct, credentials, education and client protection that all lawyers must meet to practice law.
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

 
Paralegals
Formerly referred to as a “Legal Assistant”, paralegals usually have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes at a community college. They are capable of independent legal work, performed subject to the general supervision of a lawyer. A paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance.
An unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the practice of law. Usually, paralegals prepare legal documents, maintain records and files and conduct research to assist lawyers or other professionals. Independent paralegals provide legal services to the public as allowed by government legislation, or provide paralegal services on contract to law firms or other establishments. Specific job titles associated with paralegals include:

corporate paralegal
family law paralegal
independent paralegal
senior paralegal
litigation paralegal
land titles examiner
legal technician
legal assistant
legal researcher
notary public
law clerk
title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
The procedure to become a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits, differs by province and territory. In Ontario, you must complete an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. In Manitoba, the application is made with the Minister of Finance, and in Alberta, notary public appointments are made by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
For help in deciding whether a lawyer or a paralegal is the right professional for your situation, visit your provincial or territorial Law Society. For more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits contact your provincial government office.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child.

				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, in most cases, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child’s father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the law imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The law provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16, 17 or 18 years of age or older, depending on the province, if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by federal and provincial government guidelines and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant’s costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to the negligence or misdeeds of professionals in their work. Included in this category are doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and can be expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the stand","

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practises, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service required and the type of professional providing it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, before administering any kind of medical treatment, medical practitioners have an obligation to advise the patient fully of associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has are based on the law and written guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing a full medical history to your doctor or telling the truth about the case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession.
For example, if your complaint is with a medical doctor, you may contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Québec it is the Collège des médecins du Québec; in Yukon, the Yukon Medical Council; Health and Social Services in the Northwest Territories; and Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavut. Visit Health Law for links to the applicable medical organization where you live.
If your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants where you live. Visit Business Law for a link.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Specialty – Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index – Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies.

A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),What is a structured settlement?,486,"
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For","
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
 
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfills the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable, and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The “guarantee period” may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. Funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or his or her agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first, and then purchase a structured settlement annuity after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed, leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements you should consult a lawyer.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"
				Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,
It exists separate and apart from its shareholders or members,

It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.

In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.

Yukon: Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Care Consent Act.

 
Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.

Employment Law,What is wrongful dismissal?,606,"
				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed. However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you. If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.

What is ’cause’ for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was ’cause’, also known as ‘just cause”. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

 
What is not ’cause’ for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but this wrong does not constitute a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee’s work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.
More information on termination of employment may also be found from your provincial or territorial Ministry of Labour.  In Quebec, visit the Standards Commission, equity, health and safety at work (CNESST).

				Was your question answered?
			It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed. However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you. If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.
 
What is ’cause’ for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was ’cause’, also known as ‘just cause”. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

				What is considered trafficking?

“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.

Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.

What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.


Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

In British Columbia, section 49 of its Community Charter gives specific consideration to “special powers in relation to dangerous dogs”.
In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit owning a dog for a certain time.
Currently, only the province of Ontario and the City of Winnipeg have specifically banned “pit bulls” from being bred, imported or transferred.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.

Internet and Cyber Law,Cyberbullying,363,"
				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say.","
				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.

				Was your question answered?
			The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and

Business Law,Extending credit and credit checks,229,"
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,

Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver’s Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

 1. Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can claim a security or lien on a debtor’s specific asset, usually the item you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor.
A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

Business Law,Importing and exporting,236,"
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account befo","
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada’s Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, visit CBSA.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Regional Business Service Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

Having said that however, for practical purposes, any record held at a government office, containing information about a person’s criminal activity or involvement is considered to be a type of criminal record. This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.
For more information about removing a criminal record, call the Pardons Canada telephone support line, toll-free at 1-877-929-6011 or in Toronto at 416-929-6011, or visit their website at www.pardons.org.

You will also need to ensure that all tax filings, such as payroll and PST/GST/HST, are up-to-date and that no taxes are owing.

Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information regarding closing tax accounts.
Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under your provincial corporations act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
Although a corporation may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all provincial tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, your provincial Ministry of Finance will deny the application for dissolution. Therefore, you first must obtain proof from the Ministry of Finance that your corporation is in compliance with the tax laws and does not have any outstanding taxes. Once this is obtained, you can then proceed and your ministry or department responsible for Consumer Affairs can dissolve the corporation. You will likely need to provide copies of your Articles of Incorporation and a fee.
To obtain more information or forms of dissolution, contact your provincial Corporate Registry or visit Canada Business Network. For information on dissolving a business incorporated under the federal Canada Business Corporations Act, visit Corporations Canada.
For legal advice and assistance, consult a lawyer.

				To discriminate means to make distinctions. Discrimination in itself is not prohibited by human rights laws. Discrimination is prohibited only based on certain grounds in certain situations.
Discrimination does not have to be intentional for it to be against the law. It is the effect on the individual that matters. Discrimination can also come about when a rule applied equally to everybody has a disproportionate effect on a particular group due to their unique needs.

For instance, only hiring employees of a certain height may constitute discrimination on the basis of sex since women are generally shorter than men.
Harassment is also a form of discrimination. Harassment means that the ‘harasser’ acts in an annoying or abusive manner that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the other person.
Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.
For more information, access your local human rights laws, or if your case is federal, the Canadian Human Rights Act. For information about filing a human rights complaint, contact your provincial or territorial Human Rights Commission, or the Canadian Human Rights Commission at www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca.

Employment Law,Employment contracts,600,"
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal.

It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For more information, you can access your provincial employment legislation, or contact your local Ministry of Labour.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are at least four advantages to owning a franchise.

You are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor.
For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice.
You enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor’s reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product.
It is sometimes easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.

Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
Most provinces have legislation that govern all types of franchise relationships, such as Ontario’s Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, and the New Brunswick Franchises Act. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Ontario, franchise sellers may be required to meet certain disclosure requirements and provide a full package of information on your rights and responsibilities. Visit the Canadian Franchise Association for information on legislation in your province.
There are many complicated legal issues involved in buying and operating franchises. Consult both a lawyer and an accountant when planning to enter into a franchise agreement.
For more information about franchises, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
Most provinces have legislation that govern all types of franchise relationships, such as Ontario’s Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, and the New Brunswick Franchises Act. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Ontario, franchise sellers may be required to meet certain disclosure requirements and provide a full package of information on your rights and responsibilities. Visit the Canadian Franchise Association for information on legislation in your province.
There are many complicated legal issues involved in buying and operating franchises. Consult both a lawyer and an accountant when planning to enter into a franchise agreement.
For more information about franchises, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force.

Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships: where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations: which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and employment insurance contributions from the employees’ paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer’s legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
 
Special considerations for home businesses

1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence. In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
 
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public’s perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person’s home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues that arise with a home business can be very complicated, you should consult a lawyer for assistance and advice.
For more information about operating a business, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.

In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
British Columbia:  A Representation Agreement concerning personal care decisions can be made under the Representation Agreement Act. Also, an Advance Directive, covering health care decisions, can be made under the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act.
Manitoba:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives Act.
New Brunswick:  Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care which includes decisions about health care can be created under the Infirm Persons Act.
Newfoundland and Labrador:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Advance Health Care Directives Act.
Northwest Territories: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
Nova Scotia: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
Nunavut: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills or Powers of Attorney for Personal Care.
Ontario: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care covering personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Substitute Decisions Act.
Prince Edward Island:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be created under the Consent to Treatment and Health Care Directives Act.
Québec:  A Mandate covering personal care, health care and financial decisions can be created under the Québec Civil Code.
Saskatchewan: A Power of Attorney for Personal Care covering personal care decisions, but excluding health care decisions, can be created under The Powers of Attorney Act.  A Health Care Directive covering only health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives and Substitute Health Care Decision Makers Act.
Yukon: Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Care Consent Act.

 
Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.
For more information on Wills, visit your provincial or territorial government.

Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.
For more information on Wills, visit your provincial or territorial government.

Provincial Social Assistance and Disability Support Programs
If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.
For more information or to apply for benefits, contact your local government office.
 
Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

Criminal Law,Impaired driving,773,"
				Impaired driving means being in control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is commonly referred to as drunk driving, and is a serious offence under the Canadian Criminal Code.
 
What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.

				Impaired driving means being in control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is commonly referred to as drunk driving, and is a serious offence under the Canadian Criminal Code.
 
What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.

Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to the negligence or misdeeds of professionals in their work. Included in this category are doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and can be expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the stand","

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practises, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service required and the type of professional providing it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, before administering any kind of medical treatment, medical practitioners have an obligation to advise the patient fully of associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has are based on the law and written guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing a full medical history to your doctor or telling the truth about the case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession.
For example, if your complaint is with a medical doctor, you may contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Québec it is the Collège des médecins du Québec; in Yukon, the Yukon Medical Council; Health and Social Services in the Northwest Territories; and Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavut. Visit Health Law for links to the applicable medical organization where you live.
If your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants where you live. Visit Business Law for a link.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession.
For example, if your complaint is with a medical doctor, you may contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Québec it is the Collège des médecins du Québec; in Yukon, the Yukon Medical Council; Health and Social Services in the Northwest Territories; and Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavut. Visit Health Law for links to the applicable medical organization where you live.
If your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants where you live. Visit Business Law for a link.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to the negligence or misdeeds of professionals in their work. Included in this category are doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and can be expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss.

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practises, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service required and the type of professional providing it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, before administering any kind of medical treatment, medical practitioners have an obligation to advise the patient fully of associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has are based on the law and written guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing a full medical history to your doctor or telling the truth about the case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for pain and suffering, if any.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Defamation: Libel and slander,480,"
				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days. Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

You can assume your spouse’s surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.

You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.
You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.

Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;

It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts’ willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go “forum shopping”. Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

				Was your question answered?
			The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself.

Other purposes beneficial to the community

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations,
Public foundations, and
Private foundations.

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
 
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public’s perspective.
 
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what is owed. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount is within the limits of your province. Or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort, and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor’s assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor’s assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means you can take possession of the asset, sell it and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to ensure your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business, contact your local government. For legal advice, consult a lawyer.

The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"
				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Capacity.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies.

A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements.

Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days. Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.
				Was your question answered?
			Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days.

People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP’s Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Business Law,Extending credit and credit checks,229,"
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,","
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver’s Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

 1. Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can claim a security or lien on a debtor’s specific asset, usually the item you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor.
A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

Internet and Cyber Law,Defamation laws (cyber-libel) and the Internet,361,"

Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts’ willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go “forum shopping”. Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

Nova Scotia Collection Agencies Act
Nunavut Consumer Protection Act
Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.

For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.

Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.

What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.


Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.

Although a corporation may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all provincial tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, your provincial Ministry of Finance will deny the application for dissolution. Therefore, you first must obtain proof from the Ministry of Finance that your corporation is in compliance with the tax laws and does not have any outstanding taxes. Once this is obtained, you can then proceed and your ministry or department responsible for Consumer Affairs can dissolve the corporation. You will likely need to provide copies of your Articles of Incorporation and a fee.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For more information, you can access your provincial employment legislation, or contact your local Ministry of Labour.

The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For more information, you can access your provincial employment legislation, or contact your local Ministry of Labour.
For legal advice about employment contract matters, consult a lawyer.

				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are at least four advantages to owning a franchise.

You are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor.
For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice.
You enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor’s reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product.
It is sometimes easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.

Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
Most provinces have legislation that govern all types of franchise relationships, such as Ontario’s Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, and the New Brunswick Franchises Act. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Ontario, franchise sellers may be required to meet certain disclosure requirements and provide a full package of information on your rights and responsibilities. Visit the Canadian Franchise Association for information on legislation in your province.
There are many complicated legal issues involved in buying and operating franchises. Consult both a lawyer and an accountant when planning to enter into a franchise agreement.

				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada’s Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, visit CBSA.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Regional Business Service Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships: where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations: which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and employment insurance contributions from the employees’ paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer’s legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
 
Special considerations for home businesses

1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence. In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
 
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public’s perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person’s home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues that arise with a home business can be very complicated, you should consult a lawyer for assistance and advice.
For more information about operating a business, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

However, some information is not readily available without requesting it, such as government salaries, internal memos, expenses, and reports on sensitive subject matters.
Generally, there are three main laws that regulate information requests. Municipal and provincial freedom of  information and protection of privacy legislation, regulate information held in municipal and provincial offices. The federal law, called the Access to Information Act, regulates information in federal offices. The procedure for requesting information is different for each level of government.
 
Provincial and municipal information
To request information from a provincial or municipal office, you must first write a letter to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Coordinator assigned to the government office from which you want to collect the information. To find out the name and mailing address of the Coordinator, you can call the government office directly or the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner in your province or territory. In your letter, state that you are making the request under The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The Coordinator has a limited amount of days, usually 30 to 60 days, to respond to your request.
If your request is denied, you can appeal to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner by filling out forms available at that office.
 
Federal information
For federal offices, you have the option of making an informal request or a formal request. These requests are made pursuant to the Access to Information Act.
Informal request
To make an informal request for information, call the office you want information from and ask who in the office you should make the request to. Write a letter to this person requesting the information. If your informal request is denied, you make make a formal request.
Formal request
To make a formal request, you are required to fill out an Access to Information Form. A generic Access to Information Request form, which can be used for most federal offices, is available online from the Government of Canada website. There is no fee. Submit the request  to the Access to Information Coordinator assigned to the federal office or agency you want information from.
Complaints
If your request is denied, or if you have a complaint about the procedure, you can speak with someone at the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada (OIC) to discuss your options. If you would like to make a complaint, you may do so for reasons, such as:

you believe you were improperly denied access to the information requested;
the request process is taking too long;
the request fees are too high;
you did not receive the information in your official language of choice; or
for other reasonable grounds.

Except in the case where your request is taking too long, you must submit your complaint to the OIC within 60 days of receiving your answer from the relevant federal institution.
The OIC will assign an Investigator to your case. The Investigator will give you an opportunity to present your complaint and will also obtain information from the federal institution in question. In many cases, the OIC Investigator will attempt to settle the complain by mediation, unless the Investigator decides the institution acted properly. The OIC will report its decision to you.
Appeals
Regardless of whether the OIC agrees with your complaint, you have the right to take your case to the Federal Court of Canada for a review of the federal institution’s original decision.
In addition, the Commissioner may also decide to take a case to the Federal Court if it involves an important point of law. In such cases, the OIC must first receive your approval to do so.

			Public right to access government information
Generally, information produced or gathered by government offices and agencies is accessible to the public. Government information can be valuable for businesses, reporters, and people involved in lawsuits. Some information is easily accessible, such as legislation, Commission Reports, or court cases because it is published and distributed in libraries, government book stores, and online. However, some information is not readily available without requesting it, such as government salaries, internal memos, expenses, and reports on sensitive subject matters.
Generally, there are three main laws that regulate information requests. Municipal and provincial freedom of  information and protection of privacy legislation, regulate information held in municipal and provincial offices. The federal law, called the Access to Information Act, regulates information in federal offices. The procedure for requesting information is different for each level of government.
 
Provincial and municipal information
To request information from a provincial or municipal office, you must first write a letter to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Coordinator assigned to the government office from which you want to collect the information. To find out the name and mailing address of the Coordinator, you can call the government office directly or the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner in your province or territory. In your letter, state that you are making the request under The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The Coordinator has a limited amount of days, usually 30 to 60 days, to respond to your request.
If your request is denied, you can appeal to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner by filling out forms available at that office.
 
Federal information
For federal offices, you have the option of making an informal request or a formal request. These requests are made pursuant to the Access to Information Act.
Informal request
To make an informal request for information, call the office you want information from and ask who in the office you should make the request to. Write a letter to this person requesting the information. If your informal request is denied, you make make a formal request.
Formal request
To make a formal request, you are required to fill out an Access to Information Form. A generic Access to Information Request form, which can be used for most federal offices, is available online from the Government of Canada website. There is no fee. Submit the request  to the Access to Information Coordinator assigned to the federal office or agency you want information from.
Complaints
If your request is denied, or if you have a complaint about the procedure, you can speak with someone at the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada (OIC) to discuss your options. If you would like to make a complaint, you may do so for reasons, such as:

you believe you were improperly denied access to the information requested;
the request process is taking too long;
the request fees are too high;
you did not receive the information in your official language of choice; or
for other reasonable grounds.

Except in the case where your request is taking too long, you must submit your complaint to the OIC within 60 days of receiving your answer from the relevant federal institution.
The OIC will assign an Investigator to your case. The Investigator will give you an opportunity to present your complaint and will also obtain information from the federal institution in question. In many cases, the OIC Investigator will attempt to settle the complain by mediation, unless the Investigator decides the institution acted properly. The OIC will report its decision to you.
Appeals
Regardless of whether the OIC agrees with your complaint, you have the right to take your case to the Federal Court of Canada for a review of the federal institution’s original decision.
In addition, the Commissioner may also decide to take a case to the Federal Court if it involves an important point of law. In such cases, the OIC must first receive your approval to do so.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.

In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.

Yukon: Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Care Consent Act.

 
Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.
For more information on Wills, visit your provincial or territorial government.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases whe","
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, in most cases, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child’s father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the law imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The law provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16, 17 or 18 years of age or older, depending on the province, if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by federal and provincial government guidelines and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills.

The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.
 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The type of things your attorney can do depend entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney  that covers all your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do and when. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future or upon a specific occurrence, then you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a Continuing Power of Attorney, or Enduring Power of Attorney. This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, check with a lawyer to determine if the document still applies should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property ?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. Generally, to give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

have reached the age of majority,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who has reached the age of majority and who is mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a bank or trust company. Often people choose financial institutions because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be set out in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign the Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include: the attorney you are appointing, the attorney’s spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child, or any person who  is a minor, which means under the age of majority.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. Considering that the management of your finances is at stake, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer for legal assistance.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.
				Was your question answered?
			Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,
It exists separate and apart from its shareholders or members,
It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","

Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province.

In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch. IX, Division IV), it is called a Mandate.
Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
 
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, thereby ensuring that your personal care will be in the hands of someone you have chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In addition, you may specify your wishes about more than health care. For example, you may have certain dietary restrictions or have determined which facility you prefer to live in should you need long-term care.
In British Columbia, the Representation Agreement Act also allows you to give your representative the authority over  the routine management of your financial affairs. In Quebec, the Mandate can contain provisions regarding both the person’s property in addition to their personal care. In Saskatchewan, although the attorney for personal care legislation applies to personal decisions, regarding such things as housing, food, and clothing, it does not apply to health care decisions, which are covered under a different Act. In New Brunswick, both a Power of Attorney for Property and a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can be included in the same document.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will or a Health Directive is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
Although the two are often confused, and, in terms of health care decisions these documents may overlap, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
For example, in Saskatchewan, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can deal with many aspects of someone’s personal care, but cannot deal with health care issues. In comparison, a Living Will sets out only wishes about your health care and not your other personal care decisions. Further, a Living Will does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf, but can simply be general instructions for future health care providers.
Although in many provinces, such as Manitoba, the government has developed a standard form that may be used, a Living Will can be in any written form. A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
To make a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

have reached the age of majority in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan; be at least 16 years of age in Ontario; and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the legislation does not state an age requirement,
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney ?
The person you give this power to may be referred to by one of the following names: attorney, agent, delegate, representative, or mandatary, depending on the province. It is important to note that the term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

have attained the age of majority (18 or 19 years of age depending on the province), except in Ontario where section 44 of the Substitute Decisions Act allows for anyone 16 years of age or older to be named as attorney,
be mentally competent,
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

In some provinces, the legislation precludes bankrupts and those with criminal records from acting as attorneys.
Above all, you should select someone you know well and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, ask that person if he or she is willing to be your attorney. Also, talk about your wishes and that person’s responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly.  You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by one or two witnesses (the number of witnesses required depends on the province).

The witnesses must:

be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
have attained the age of majority,
not be the attorney you appointed, or a spouse or common-law partner of the attorney, your own spouse or partner, your child or generally any person who is a minor.

In the province of Quebec, the Mandate must also be homologated, which means approved by the court.
 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. If it is not prepared correctly, it will not be legal. Given the importance of providing for your personal care, it is advisable to consult a lawyer when drafting a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Growth or equity – Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced – A mix of equities and fixed income securities
Global – Foreign equities or fixed income securities
Specialty – Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index – Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.

Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.

				Was your question answered?
			A mutual fund is one type of professionally managed collective investment vehicle. Mutual funds raise money by selling its shares or units to individual investors. The fund then uses this pool of money to purchase a variety of investments. Sometimes mutual funds are referred to as investment companies. Mutual funds are regulated by the securities industry. Further, in most cases, shares in the mutual fund can be bought or sold at any time.
 
Types of mutual funds
The types of funds and what they invest in include:

Money market – Short-term fixed income securities like treasury bills
Fixed income – Fixed income securities like government bonds and corporate bonds
Growth or equity – Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced – A mix of equities and fixed income securities
Global – Foreign equities or fixed income securities
Specialty – Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index – Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to the negligence or misdeeds of professionals in their work. Included in this category are doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and can be expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the stand","

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practises, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service required and the type of professional providing it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, before administering any kind of medical treatment, medical practitioners have an obligation to advise the patient fully of associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has are based on the law and written guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing a full medical history to your doctor or telling the truth about the case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession.
For example, if your complaint is with a medical doctor, you may contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Québec it is the Collège des médecins du Québec; in Yukon, the Yukon Medical Council; Health and Social Services in the Northwest Territories; and Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavut. Visit Health Law for links to the applicable medical organization where you live.
If your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants where you live. Visit Business Law for a link.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on “Marriage Contracts,” the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
 
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
 
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if a court ordered the terms of the separation agreement. If you are concerned your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the agreement, file it with your provincial government. This will help enforce any schedule of payments under it. Responsibility for enforcing registered agreements in most provinces comes under the Justice or Attorney General’s ministry or department.   You can also file an agreement with the family law court in your province. Most provinces have enforcement agencies.
For example, in British Columbia, it is called the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program. In New Brunswick, it is the Family Support Orders Service. In Nova Scotia it is the Maintenance Enforcement Program; and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it is the Support Enforcement Program.
 
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important so each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements, refer to your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"
				Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,
It exists separate and apart from its shareholders or members,
It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and

				Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,

It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.

In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine”.
Notaries public are governed by their provincial or territorial notaries acts. Unlike lawyers and paralegals, they do not have to undergo special education or training, and a notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers may work for private law firms, legal aid, as Crown prosecutors, or in offices at the federal, provincial and municipal level of government, as well as for businesses.
Lawyers must complete years of university education and practical training. Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society. In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer). They are governed by their provincial Law Society which establishes and enforces standards of conduct, credentials, education and client protection that all lawyers must meet to practice law.
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

 
Paralegals
Formerly referred to as a “Legal Assistant”, paralegals usually have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes at a community college. They are capable of independent legal work, performed subject to the general supervision of a lawyer. A paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance.
An unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the practice of law. Usually, paralegals prepare legal documents, maintain records and files and conduct research to assist lawyers or other professionals. Independent paralegals provide legal services to the public as allowed by government legislation, or provide paralegal services on contract to law firms or other establishments. Specific job titles associated with paralegals include:

corporate paralegal
family law paralegal
independent paralegal
senior paralegal
litigation paralegal
land titles examiner
legal technician
legal assistant
legal researcher
notary public
law clerk
title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
The procedure to become a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits, differs by province and territory. In Ontario, you must complete an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. In Manitoba, the application is made with the Minister of Finance, and in Alberta, notary public appointments are made by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
For help in deciding whether a lawyer or a paralegal is the right professional for your situation, visit your provincial or territorial Law Society. For more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits contact your provincial government office.

Notaries public are governed by their provincial or territorial notaries acts. Unlike lawyers and paralegals, they do not have to undergo special education or training, and a notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers may work for private law firms, legal aid, as Crown prosecutors, or in offices at the federal, provincial and municipal level of government, as well as for businesses.
Lawyers must complete years of university education and practical training. Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society. In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer). They are governed by their provincial Law Society which establishes and enforces standards of conduct, credentials, education and client protection that all lawyers must meet to practice law.
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

 
Paralegals
Formerly referred to as a “Legal Assistant”, paralegals usually have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes at a community college. They are capable of independent legal work, performed subject to the general supervision of a lawyer. A paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance.
An unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the practice of law. Usually, paralegals prepare legal documents, maintain records and files and conduct research to assist lawyers or other professionals. Independent paralegals provide legal services to the public as allowed by government legislation, or provide paralegal services on contract to law firms or other establishments. Specific job titles associated with paralegals include:

corporate paralegal
family law paralegal
independent paralegal
senior paralegal
litigation paralegal
land titles examiner
legal technician
legal assistant
legal researcher
notary public
law clerk
title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
The procedure to become a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits, differs by province and territory. In Ontario, you must complete an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. In Manitoba, the application is made with the Minister of Finance, and in Alberta, notary public appointments are made by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
For help in deciding whether a lawyer or a paralegal is the right professional for your situation, visit your provincial or territorial Law Society. For more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits contact your provincial government office.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases whe","
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, in most cases, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child’s father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the law imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The law provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16, 17 or 18 years of age or older, depending on the province, if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by federal and provincial government guidelines and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),What is a structured settlement?,486,"
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.

As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
 
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfills the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable, and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The “guarantee period” may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. Funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or his or her agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first, and then purchase a structured settlement annuity after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed, leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements you should consult a lawyer.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?,154,"
				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch.

				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch. IX, Division IV), it is called a Mandate.
Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
 
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, thereby ensuring that your personal care will be in the hands of someone you have chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In addition, you may specify your wishes about more than health care. For example, you may have certain dietary restrictions or have determined which facility you prefer to live in should you need long-term care.
In British Columbia, the Representation Agreement Act also allows you to give your representative the authority over  the routine management of your financial affairs. In Quebec, the Mandate can contain provisions regarding both the person’s property in addition to their personal care. In Saskatchewan, although the attorney for personal care legislation applies to personal decisions, regarding such things as housing, food, and clothing, it does not apply to health care decisions, which are covered under a different Act. In New Brunswick, both a Power of Attorney for Property and a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can be included in the same document.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will or a Health Directive is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
Although the two are often confused, and, in terms of health care decisions these documents may overlap, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
For example, in Saskatchewan, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can deal with many aspects of someone’s personal care, but cannot deal with health care issues. In comparison, a Living Will sets out only wishes about your health care and not your other personal care decisions. Further, a Living Will does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf, but can simply be general instructions for future health care providers.
Although in many provinces, such as Manitoba, the government has developed a standard form that may be used, a Living Will can be in any written form. A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
To make a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

have reached the age of majority in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan; be at least 16 years of age in Ontario; and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the legislation does not state an age requirement,
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney ?
The person you give this power to may be referred to by one of the following names: attorney, agent, delegate, representative, or mandatary, depending on the province. It is important to note that the term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

have attained the age of majority (18 or 19 years of age depending on the province), except in Ontario where section 44 of the Substitute Decisions Act allows for anyone 16 years of age or older to be named as attorney,
be mentally competent,
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

In some provinces, the legislation precludes bankrupts and those with criminal records from acting as attorneys.
Above all, you should select someone you know well and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, ask that person if he or she is willing to be your attorney. Also, talk about your wishes and that person’s responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly.  You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by one or two witnesses (the number of witnesses required depends on the province).

The witnesses must:

be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
have attained the age of majority,
not be the attorney you appointed, or a spouse or common-law partner of the attorney, your own spouse or partner, your child or generally any person who is a minor.

In the province of Quebec, the Mandate must also be homologated, which means approved by the court.
 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. If it is not prepared correctly, it will not be legal. Given the importance of providing for your personal care, it is advisable to consult a lawyer when drafting a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				Was your question answered?
			What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Government and The Justice System,Change your name,716,"
				Many people change their name when they get married, as well as for other personal or professional reasons. Each province and territory has different procedures involving changing a person’s name, depending on their age and the circumstances under which they want it changed.
Generally, there are four ways to change your name:

You can assume your spouse’s surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.
You can legally change your surname based on marital status. The right to change one’s surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.

You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.
You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.
To find out the rules and steps to change your name, visit your provincial government Vital Statistics office.

Family Law,Child support,117,"
				While courts in each province have the power to make orders for child support, if parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, usually the other parent is responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children.

Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.

The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.
 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The type of things your attorney can do depend entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney  that covers all your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do and when. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future or upon a specific occurrence, then you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a Continuing Power of Attorney, or Enduring Power of Attorney. This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, check with a lawyer to determine if the document still applies should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property ?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. Generally, to give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

have reached the age of majority,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who has reached the age of majority and who is mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a bank or trust company. Often people choose financial institutions because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be set out in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign the Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include: the attorney you are appointing, the attorney’s spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child, or any person who  is a minor, which means under the age of majority.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. Considering that the management of your finances is at stake, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer for legal assistance.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. Considering that the management of your finances is at stake, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer for legal assistance.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Newfoundland Collections Act
NWT Consumer Protection Act
Nova Scotia Collection Agencies Act
Nunavut Consumer Protection Act
Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.
For the legislation regarding what collections agencies can and cannot do in your province or territory, visit Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of Consumer Affairs.
If you require legal help, contact a lawyer.

Family Law,Common-law relationships,121,"
				When two people live together in a conjugal relationship and are not married, they may be considered to be living in a common-law relationship. If you are living in a common-law relationship, you will have a number of rights and obligations arising under family law, tax law, welfare and family benefits, and employee benefit plans. Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.

Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.

Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"
				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or ‘certified’ by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant’s costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				Provincial governments have many rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (includi","

You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (including a single individual) a court believes will honour the best interests of the child. All provinces allow same-sex adoptions. If an adult (someone who has attained the age of majority) is to be adopted, there may be restrictions on who can adopt (usually, only the person or couple who tended to the individual when he or she was a minor).
 
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In most jurisdictions, consent for the adoption will be required from a child over the age of 12. In Quebec, consent is required from a child 10 years old and older.  In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Depending on the province, the child must be a certain number of days old before written permission for adoption can be given, such as seven days in Ontario and Newfoundland. In British Columbia, consent cannot be given until the baby is 10 days old. Again, depending on the province, there is also a time period in which the natural parents can change their minds and cancel the permission. For instance, in British Columbia and Quebec, a birth mother can withdraw her consent within 30 days of the child’s birth, while in Ontario, the mother has 21 days. If permission is cancelled within the prescribed period, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the period has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their minds about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents’ consent.
How to adopt a child
There are generally two common ways to adopt a child, depending on the province: public adoption and private adoption. Public adoption is through a local Children’s Aid Society, provincial Child Welfare office, or similar public agency. To adopt a child through a public agency, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved, the agency will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the court gives the adoption order.
The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licensed by a provincial government. The process is very similar to going through the public agency. Note that there are no provincial caps on adoption fees, which can range from $6,000 to $25,000.
Regardless of what province or territory they live in, generally, every potential adoptive parent must complete a homestudy, sometimes called a family assessment, conducted by a social worker through visits to the home, to make sure the adoption is suitable for the parents and the child. In most cases, the home study includes an educational component to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child.
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, in most cases, you do not need to go through a public or private adoption agency, but you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order.
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 – Adopting a child from abroad.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For more information on the adoption process and laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.

				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
British Columbia:  A Representation Agreement concerning personal care decisions can be made under the Representation Agreement Act. Also, an Advance Directive, covering health care decisions, can be made under the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act.
Manitoba:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives Act.
New Brunswick:  Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care which includes decisions about health care can be created under the Infirm Persons Act.
Newfoundland and Labrador:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Advance Health Care Directives Act.
Northwest Territories: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
Nova Scotia: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
Nunavut: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills or Powers of Attorney for Personal Care.
Ontario: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care covering personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Substitute Decisions Act.
Prince Edward Island:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be created under the Consent to Treatment and Health Care Directives Act.
Québec:  A Mandate covering personal care, health care and financial decisions can be created under the Québec Civil Code.
Saskatchewan: A Power of Attorney for Personal Care covering personal care decisions, but excluding health care decisions, can be created under The Powers of Attorney Act.  A Health Care Directive covering only health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives and Substitute Health Care Decision Makers Act.
Yukon: Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Care Consent Act.

 
Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.
For more information on Wills, visit your provincial or territorial government.

Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.

Manitoba:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives Act.
New Brunswick:  Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care which includes decisions about health care can be created under the Infirm Persons Act.
Newfoundland and Labrador:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Advance Health Care Directives Act.

Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.

IX, Division IV), it is called a Mandate.
Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
 
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, thereby ensuring that your personal care will be in the hands of someone you have chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In addition, you may specify your wishes about more than health care. For example, you may have certain dietary restrictions or have determined which facility you prefer to live in should you need long-term care.
In British Columbia, the Representation Agreement Act also allows you to give your representative the authority over  the routine management of your financial affairs. In Quebec, the Mandate can contain provisions regarding both the person’s property in addition to their personal care. In Saskatchewan, although the attorney for personal care legislation applies to personal decisions, regarding such things as housing, food, and clothing, it does not apply to health care decisions, which are covered under a different Act. In New Brunswick, both a Power of Attorney for Property and a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can be included in the same document.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will or a Health Directive is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
Although the two are often confused, and, in terms of health care decisions these documents may overlap, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
For example, in Saskatchewan, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can deal with many aspects of someone’s personal care, but cannot deal with health care issues. In comparison, a Living Will sets out only wishes about your health care and not your other personal care decisions. Further, a Living Will does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf, but can simply be general instructions for future health care providers.
Although in many provinces, such as Manitoba, the government has developed a standard form that may be used, a Living Will can be in any written form. A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
To make a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

have reached the age of majority in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan; be at least 16 years of age in Ontario; and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the legislation does not state an age requirement,
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney ?
The person you give this power to may be referred to by one of the following names: attorney, agent, delegate, representative, or mandatary, depending on the province. It is important to note that the term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

have attained the age of majority (18 or 19 years of age depending on the province), except in Ontario where section 44 of the Substitute Decisions Act allows for anyone 16 years of age or older to be named as attorney,
be mentally competent,
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

In some provinces, the legislation precludes bankrupts and those with criminal records from acting as attorneys.
Above all, you should select someone you know well and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, ask that person if he or she is willing to be your attorney. Also, talk about your wishes and that person’s responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly.  You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by one or two witnesses (the number of witnesses required depends on the province).

The witnesses must:

be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
have attained the age of majority,
not be the attorney you appointed, or a spouse or common-law partner of the attorney, your own spouse or partner, your child or generally any person who is a minor.

In the province of Quebec, the Mandate must also be homologated, which means approved by the court.
 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. If it is not prepared correctly, it will not be legal. Given the importance of providing for your personal care, it is advisable to consult a lawyer when drafting a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"
				Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.
 
				Was your question answered?
			Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Employment Law,What is wrongful dismissal?,606,"
				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed. However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you. If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.

What is ’cause’ for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was ’cause’, also known as ‘just cause”. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

 
What is not ’cause’ for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but this wrong does not constitute a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee’s work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.
More information on termination of employment may also be found from your provincial or territorial Ministry of Labour.  In Quebec, visit the Standards Commission, equity, health and safety at work (CNESST).

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases whe","
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, in most cases, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child’s father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the law imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The law provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16, 17 or 18 years of age or older, depending on the province, if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by federal and provincial government guidelines and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.

The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on “Marriage Contracts,” the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
 
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
 
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if a court ordered the terms of the separation agreement. If you are concerned your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the agreement, file it with your provincial government. This will help enforce any schedule of payments under it. Responsibility for enforcing registered agreements in most provinces comes under the Justice or Attorney General’s ministry or department.   You can also file an agreement with the family law court in your province. Most provinces have enforcement agencies.
For example, in British Columbia, it is called the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program. In New Brunswick, it is the Family Support Orders Service. In Nova Scotia it is the Maintenance Enforcement Program; and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it is the Support Enforcement Program.
 
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important so each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements, refer to your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine”.
Notaries public are governed by their provincial or territorial notaries acts. Unlike lawyers and paralegals, they do not have to undergo special education or training, and a notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers may work for private law firms, legal aid, as Crown prosecutors, or in offices at the federal, provincial and municipal level of government, as well as for businesses.
Lawyers must complete years of university education and practical training. Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society. In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer). They are governed by their provincial Law Society which establishes and enforces standards of conduct, credentials, education and client protection that all lawyers must meet to practice law.
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

 
Paralegals
Formerly referred to as a “Legal Assistant”, paralegals usually have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes at a community college. They are capable of independent legal work, performed subject to the general supervision of a lawyer. A paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance.
An unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the practice of law. Usually, paralegals prepare legal documents, maintain records and files and conduct research to assist lawyers or other professionals. Independent paralegals provide legal services to the public as allowed by government legislation, or provide paralegal services on contract to law firms or other establishments. Specific job titles associated with paralegals include:

corporate paralegal
family law paralegal
independent paralegal
senior paralegal
litigation paralegal
land titles examiner
legal technician
legal assistant
legal researcher
notary public
law clerk
title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
The procedure to become a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits, differs by province and territory. In Ontario, you must complete an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. In Manitoba, the application is made with the Minister of Finance, and in Alberta, notary public appointments are made by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
For help in deciding whether a lawyer or a paralegal is the right professional for your situation, visit your provincial or territorial Law Society. For more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits contact your provincial government office.
				Was your question answered?
			A lawyer is a licensed professional entitled to draw up legal documents, offer legal advice and opinions, and prosecute or defend people in law courts. Generally speaking, a paralegal is a paraprofessional who has the required education and experience to assist licensed lawyers in their legal work.  One of the most important differences between a lawyer and a paralegal is that a lawyer can give legal advice.  Also, while lawyers can represent clients in any legal issue, paralegals can only represent clients in limited situations.
In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine”.
Notaries public are governed by their provincial or territorial notaries acts. Unlike lawyers and paralegals, they do not have to undergo special education or training, and a notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers may work for private law firms, legal aid, as Crown prosecutors, or in offices at the federal, provincial and municipal level of government, as well as for businesses.
Lawyers must complete years of university education and practical training. Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society. In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer). They are governed by their provincial Law Society which establishes and enforces standards of conduct, credentials, education and client protection that all lawyers must meet to practice law.
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

 
Paralegals
Formerly referred to as a “Legal Assistant”, paralegals usually have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes at a community college. They are capable of independent legal work, performed subject to the general supervision of a lawyer. A paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance.
An unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the practice of law. Usually, paralegals prepare legal documents, maintain records and files and conduct research to assist lawyers or other professionals. Independent paralegals provide legal services to the public as allowed by government legislation, or provide paralegal services on contract to law firms or other establishments. Specific job titles associated with paralegals include:

corporate paralegal
family law paralegal
independent paralegal
senior paralegal
litigation paralegal
land titles examiner
legal technician
legal assistant
legal researcher
notary public
law clerk
title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couple","

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Family Law,Child support,117,"
				While courts in each province have the power to make orders for child support, if parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, usually the other parent is responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.

The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.

The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount is within the limits of your province. Or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort, and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor’s assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor’s assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means you can take possession of the asset, sell it and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to ensure your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business, contact your local government. For legal advice, consult a lawyer.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or ‘certified’ by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant’s costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
 
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfills the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable, and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The “guarantee period” may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. Funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or his or her agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first, and then purchase a structured settlement annuity after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed, leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

				Canada’s Anti-terrorism Act, 2015 (the Act) received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015.
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"
				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

Generally, there are four ways to change your name:

You can assume your spouse’s surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.

You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.
You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

If the guarantors do not pay the loan, the bank can seize and sell the assets of the business and take the money it is owed from the proceeds. Any money remaining after the sale of the assets must be returned to the business. If the business assets are not sufficient to repay the bank loan, the bank can take legal action against the guarantors.
Borrowing money for a business can be complicated and has serious ramifications if the loan is not repaid. Before signing any agreements with the bank, you should seek legal assistance from a lawyer.

Having said that however, for practical purposes, any record held at a government office, containing information about a person’s criminal activity or involvement is considered to be a type of criminal record. This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?,154,"
				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch. IX, Division IV), it is called a Mandate.

				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch. IX, Division IV), it is called a Mandate.
Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
 
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, thereby ensuring that your personal care will be in the hands of someone you have chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In addition, you may specify your wishes about more than health care. For example, you may have certain dietary restrictions or have determined which facility you prefer to live in should you need long-term care.
In British Columbia, the Representation Agreement Act also allows you to give your representative the authority over  the routine management of your financial affairs. In Quebec, the Mandate can contain provisions regarding both the person’s property in addition to their personal care. In Saskatchewan, although the attorney for personal care legislation applies to personal decisions, regarding such things as housing, food, and clothing, it does not apply to health care decisions, which are covered under a different Act. In New Brunswick, both a Power of Attorney for Property and a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can be included in the same document.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will or a Health Directive is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
Although the two are often confused, and, in terms of health care decisions these documents may overlap, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
For example, in Saskatchewan, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can deal with many aspects of someone’s personal care, but cannot deal with health care issues. In comparison, a Living Will sets out only wishes about your health care and not your other personal care decisions. Further, a Living Will does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf, but can simply be general instructions for future health care providers.
Although in many provinces, such as Manitoba, the government has developed a standard form that may be used, a Living Will can be in any written form. A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
To make a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

have reached the age of majority in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan; be at least 16 years of age in Ontario; and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the legislation does not state an age requirement,
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney ?
The person you give this power to may be referred to by one of the following names: attorney, agent, delegate, representative, or mandatary, depending on the province. It is important to note that the term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

have attained the age of majority (18 or 19 years of age depending on the province), except in Ontario where section 44 of the Substitute Decisions Act allows for anyone 16 years of age or older to be named as attorney,
be mentally competent,
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

In some provinces, the legislation precludes bankrupts and those with criminal records from acting as attorneys.
Above all, you should select someone you know well and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, ask that person if he or she is willing to be your attorney. Also, talk about your wishes and that person’s responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly.  You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by one or two witnesses (the number of witnesses required depends on the province).

The witnesses must:

be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
have attained the age of majority,
not be the attorney you appointed, or a spouse or common-law partner of the attorney, your own spouse or partner, your child or generally any person who is a minor.

In the province of Quebec, the Mandate must also be homologated, which means approved by the court.
 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. If it is not prepared correctly, it will not be legal. Given the importance of providing for your personal care, it is advisable to consult a lawyer when drafting a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Business Law,Extending credit and credit checks,229,"
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver’s Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

 1. Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can claim a security or lien on a debtor’s specific asset, usually the item you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor.
A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.

If you are living in a common-law relationship, you will have a number of rights and obligations arising under family law, tax law, welfare and family benefits, and employee benefit plans. Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.

Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

				What is considered trafficking?

“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.

Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.

What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.


Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are at least four advantages to owning a franchise.

You are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor.
For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice.
You enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor’s reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product.
It is sometimes easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.

Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
Most provinces have legislation that govern all types of franchise relationships, such as Ontario’s Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, and the New Brunswick Franchises Act. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Ontario, franchise sellers may be required to meet certain disclosure requirements and provide a full package of information on your rights and responsibilities. Visit the Canadian Franchise Association for information on legislation in your province.
There are many complicated legal issues involved in buying and operating franchises. Consult both a lawyer and an accountant when planning to enter into a franchise agreement.
For more information about franchises, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

Nunavut Consumer Protection Act

PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.
For the legislation regarding what collections agencies can and cannot do in your province or territory, visit Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of Consumer Affairs.
If you require legal help, contact a lawyer.

If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.
For more information or to apply for benefits, contact your local government office.
 
Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

Submit the request  to the Access to Information Coordinator assigned to the federal office or agency you want information from.
Complaints
If your request is denied, or if you have a complaint about the procedure, you can speak with someone at the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada (OIC) to discuss your options. If you would like to make a complaint, you may do so for reasons, such as:

The OIC will assign an Investigator to your case. The Investigator will give you an opportunity to present your complaint and will also obtain information from the federal institution in question. In many cases, the OIC Investigator will attempt to settle the complain by mediation, unless the Investigator decides the institution acted properly. The OIC will report its decision to you.
Appeals
Regardless of whether the OIC agrees with your complaint, you have the right to take your case to the Federal Court of Canada for a review of the federal institution’s original decision.
In addition, the Commissioner may also decide to take a case to the Federal Court if it involves an important point of law. In such cases, the OIC must first receive your approval to do so.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under your provincial corporations act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
Although a corporation may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all provincial tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, your provincial Ministry of Finance will deny the application for dissolution. Therefore, you first must obtain proof from the Ministry of Finance that your corporation is in compliance with the tax laws and does not have any outstanding taxes. Once this is obtained, you can then proceed and your ministry or department responsible for Consumer Affairs can dissolve the corporation. You will likely need to provide copies of your Articles of Incorporation and a fee.
To obtain more information or forms of dissolution, contact your provincial Corporate Registry or visit Canada Business Network. For information on dissolving a business incorporated under the federal Canada Business Corporations Act, visit Corporations Canada.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases whe","
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, in most cases, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child’s father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the law imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The law provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16, 17 or 18 years of age or older, depending on the province, if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by federal and provincial government guidelines and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

The types of funds and what they invest in include:

Money market – Short-term fixed income securities like treasury bills
Fixed income – Fixed income securities like government bonds and corporate bonds
Growth or equity – Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced – A mix of equities and fixed income securities

Specialty – Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index – Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from your provincial or territorial financial securities commission.

General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships: where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations: which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and employment insurance contributions from the employees’ paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer’s legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
 
Special considerations for home businesses

1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence. In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
 
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public’s perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person’s home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues that arise with a home business can be very complicated, you should consult a lawyer for assistance and advice.
For more information about operating a business, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

				A lawyer is a licensed professional entitled to draw up legal documents, offer legal advice and opinions, and prosecute or defend people in law courts. Generally speaking, a paralegal is a paraprofessional who has the required education and experience to assist licensed lawyers in their legal work.  One of the most important differences between a lawyer and a paralegal is that a lawyer can give legal advice.  Also, while lawyers can represent clients in any legal issue, paralegals can only represent clients in limited situations.
In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine","

In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine”.
Notaries public are governed by their provincial or territorial notaries acts. Unlike lawyers and paralegals, they do not have to undergo special education or training, and a notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers may work for private law firms, legal aid, as Crown prosecutors, or in offices at the federal, provincial and municipal level of government, as well as for businesses.
Lawyers must complete years of university education and practical training. Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society. In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer). They are governed by their provincial Law Society which establishes and enforces standards of conduct, credentials, education and client protection that all lawyers must meet to practice law.
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

 
Paralegals
Formerly referred to as a “Legal Assistant”, paralegals usually have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes at a community college. They are capable of independent legal work, performed subject to the general supervision of a lawyer. A paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance.
An unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the practice of law. Usually, paralegals prepare legal documents, maintain records and files and conduct research to assist lawyers or other professionals. Independent paralegals provide legal services to the public as allowed by government legislation, or provide paralegal services on contract to law firms or other establishments. Specific job titles associated with paralegals include:

corporate paralegal
family law paralegal
independent paralegal
senior paralegal
litigation paralegal
land titles examiner
legal technician
legal assistant
legal researcher
notary public
law clerk
title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
The procedure to become a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits, differs by province and territory. In Ontario, you must complete an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. In Manitoba, the application is made with the Minister of Finance, and in Alberta, notary public appointments are made by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
For help in deciding whether a lawyer or a paralegal is the right professional for your situation, visit your provincial or territorial Law Society. For more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits contact your provincial government office.

Business Law,Importing and exporting,236,"
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account befo","
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada’s Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, visit CBSA.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Regional Business Service Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

Business Law,Franchises,234,"
				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are at least four advantages to owning a franchise.

You are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor.
For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice.
You enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor’s reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product.
It is sometimes easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.

Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
Most provinces have legislation that govern all types of franchise relationships, such as Ontario’s Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, and the New Brunswick Franchises Act. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Ontario, franchise sellers may be required to meet certain disclosure requirements and provide a full package of information on your rights and responsibilities. Visit the Canadian Franchise Association for information on legislation in your province.
There are many complicated legal issues involved in buying and operating franchises. Consult both a lawyer and an accountant when planning to enter into a franchise agreement.
For more information about franchises, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to the negligence or misdeeds of professionals in their work. Included in this category are doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and can be expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the stand","

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practises, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service required and the type of professional providing it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, before administering any kind of medical treatment, medical practitioners have an obligation to advise the patient fully of associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has are based on the law and written guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing a full medical history to your doctor or telling the truth about the case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession.
For example, if your complaint is with a medical doctor, you may contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Québec it is the Collège des médecins du Québec; in Yukon, the Yukon Medical Council; Health and Social Services in the Northwest Territories; and Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavut. Visit Health Law for links to the applicable medical organization where you live.
If your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants where you live. Visit Business Law for a link.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.

Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.
For more information on Wills, visit your provincial or territorial government.
				Was your question answered?
			A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Defamation: Libel and slander,480,"
				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.

The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days. Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","

There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"
				Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,
It exists separate and apart from its shareholders or members,
It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and

It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.

Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.

Harassment is also a form of discrimination. Harassment means that the ‘harasser’ acts in an annoying or abusive manner that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the other person.
Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.

General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships: where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations: which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and employment insurance contributions from the employees’ paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer’s legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
 
Special considerations for home businesses

1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence. In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
 
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public’s perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person’s home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues that arise with a home business can be very complicated, you should consult a lawyer for assistance and advice.
For more information about operating a business, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

Employment Law,Employment contracts,600,"
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For more information, you can access your provincial employment legislation, or contact your local Ministry of Labour.

Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts’ willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go “forum shopping”. Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

Internet and Cyber Law,Cyberbullying,363,"
				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say.","

Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP’s Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Further, in most cases, shares in the mutual fund can be bought or sold at any time.

Types of mutual funds
The types of funds and what they invest in include:

Money market – Short-term fixed income securities like treasury bills
Fixed income – Fixed income securities like government bonds and corporate bonds
Growth or equity – Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced – A mix of equities and fixed income securities
Global – Foreign equities or fixed income securities
Specialty – Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index – Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from your provincial or territorial financial securities commission.

Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from your provincial or territorial financial securities commission.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);

				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

Municipal by-laws throughout the country, and some provincial legislation, such as Yukon’s Dog Act and Ontario’s Dog Owners’ Liability Act, make dog owners liable for any damage caused by bites to persons or other domestic animals. In British Columbia, section 49 of its Community Charter gives specific consideration to “special powers in relation to dangerous dogs”.
In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit owning a dog for a certain time.
Currently, only the province of Ontario and the City of Winnipeg have specifically banned “pit bulls” from being bred, imported or transferred.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Property?,157,"
				 
A Power of Attorney for Property (or Finances) is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills.

The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.
 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The type of things your attorney can do depend entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney  that covers all your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do and when. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future or upon a specific occurrence, then you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a Continuing Power of Attorney, or Enduring Power of Attorney. This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, check with a lawyer to determine if the document still applies should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property ?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. Generally, to give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

have reached the age of majority,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who has reached the age of majority and who is mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a bank or trust company. Often people choose financial institutions because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be set out in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign the Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include: the attorney you are appointing, the attorney’s spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child, or any person who  is a minor, which means under the age of majority.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. Considering that the management of your finances is at stake, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer for legal assistance.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from your provincial or territorial government.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.
				Was your question answered?
			Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,
It exists separate and apart from its shareholders or members,
It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				Provincial governments have many rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.

You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (including a single individual) a court believes will honour the best interests of the child. All provinces allow same-sex adoptions. If an adult (someone who has attained the age of majority) is to be adopted, there may be restrictions on who can adopt (usually, only the person or couple who tended to the individual when he or she was a minor).
 
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In most jurisdictions, consent for the adoption will be required from a child over the age of 12. In Quebec, consent is required from a child 10 years old and older.  In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Depending on the province, the child must be a certain number of days old before written permission for adoption can be given, such as seven days in Ontario and Newfoundland. In British Columbia, consent cannot be given until the baby is 10 days old. Again, depending on the province, there is also a time period in which the natural parents can change their minds and cancel the permission. For instance, in British Columbia and Quebec, a birth mother can withdraw her consent within 30 days of the child’s birth, while in Ontario, the mother has 21 days. If permission is cancelled within the prescribed period, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the period has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their minds about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents’ consent.
How to adopt a child
There are generally two common ways to adopt a child, depending on the province: public adoption and private adoption. Public adoption is through a local Children’s Aid Society, provincial Child Welfare office, or similar public agency. To adopt a child through a public agency, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved, the agency will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the court gives the adoption order.
The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licensed by a provincial government. The process is very similar to going through the public agency. Note that there are no provincial caps on adoption fees, which can range from $6,000 to $25,000.
Regardless of what province or territory they live in, generally, every potential adoptive parent must complete a homestudy, sometimes called a family assessment, conducted by a social worker through visits to the home, to make sure the adoption is suitable for the parents and the child. In most cases, the home study includes an educational component to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child.
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, in most cases, you do not need to go through a public or private adoption agency, but you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order.
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 – Adopting a child from abroad.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For more information on the adoption process and laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.

Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
British Columbia:  A Representation Agreement concerning personal care decisions can be made under the Representation Agreement Act. Also, an Advance Directive, covering health care decisions, can be made under the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act.

New Brunswick:  Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care which includes decisions about health care can be created under the Infirm Persons Act.
Newfoundland and Labrador:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Advance Health Care Directives Act.
Northwest Territories: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Personal Directives Act.

Québec:  A Mandate covering personal care, health care and financial decisions can be created under the Québec Civil Code.

Yukon: Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Care Consent Act.

 
Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.
For more information on Wills, visit your provincial or territorial government.

Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to","
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on “Marriage Contracts,” the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
 
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
 
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if a court ordered the terms of the separation agreement. If you are concerned your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the agreement, file it with your provincial government. This will help enforce any schedule of payments under it. Responsibility for enforcing registered agreements in most provinces comes under the Justice or Attorney General’s ministry or department.   You can also file an agreement with the family law court in your province. Most provinces have enforcement agencies.
For example, in British Columbia, it is called the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program. In New Brunswick, it is the Family Support Orders Service. In Nova Scotia it is the Maintenance Enforcement Program; and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it is the Support Enforcement Program.
 
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important so each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements, refer to your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care?,154,"
				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch.

				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch. IX, Division IV), it is called a Mandate.
Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
 
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, thereby ensuring that your personal care will be in the hands of someone you have chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In addition, you may specify your wishes about more than health care. For example, you may have certain dietary restrictions or have determined which facility you prefer to live in should you need long-term care.
In British Columbia, the Representation Agreement Act also allows you to give your representative the authority over  the routine management of your financial affairs. In Quebec, the Mandate can contain provisions regarding both the person’s property in addition to their personal care. In Saskatchewan, although the attorney for personal care legislation applies to personal decisions, regarding such things as housing, food, and clothing, it does not apply to health care decisions, which are covered under a different Act. In New Brunswick, both a Power of Attorney for Property and a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can be included in the same document.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will or a Health Directive is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
Although the two are often confused, and, in terms of health care decisions these documents may overlap, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
For example, in Saskatchewan, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can deal with many aspects of someone’s personal care, but cannot deal with health care issues. In comparison, a Living Will sets out only wishes about your health care and not your other personal care decisions. Further, a Living Will does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf, but can simply be general instructions for future health care providers.
Although in many provinces, such as Manitoba, the government has developed a standard form that may be used, a Living Will can be in any written form. A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
To make a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

have reached the age of majority in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan; be at least 16 years of age in Ontario; and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the legislation does not state an age requirement,
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney ?
The person you give this power to may be referred to by one of the following names: attorney, agent, delegate, representative, or mandatary, depending on the province. It is important to note that the term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

have attained the age of majority (18 or 19 years of age depending on the province), except in Ontario where section 44 of the Substitute Decisions Act allows for anyone 16 years of age or older to be named as attorney,
be mentally competent,
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

In some provinces, the legislation precludes bankrupts and those with criminal records from acting as attorneys.
Above all, you should select someone you know well and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, ask that person if he or she is willing to be your attorney. Also, talk about your wishes and that person’s responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly.  You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by one or two witnesses (the number of witnesses required depends on the province).

The witnesses must:

be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
have attained the age of majority,
not be the attorney you appointed, or a spouse or common-law partner of the attorney, your own spouse or partner, your child or generally any person who is a minor.

In the province of Quebec, the Mandate must also be homologated, which means approved by the court.
 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. If it is not prepared correctly, it will not be legal. Given the importance of providing for your personal care, it is advisable to consult a lawyer when drafting a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from your provincial or territorial government.

General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships: where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations: which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and employment insurance contributions from the employees’ paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer’s legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
 
Special considerations for home businesses

1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence. In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
 
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public’s perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person’s home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues that arise with a home business can be very complicated, you should consult a lawyer for assistance and advice.
For more information about operating a business, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, in most cases, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child’s father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the law imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The law provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16, 17 or 18 years of age or older, depending on the province, if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by federal and provincial government guidelines and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

			Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.

Business Law,Importing and exporting,236,"
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account befo","
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada’s Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, visit CBSA.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Regional Business Service Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"
				Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,
It exists separate and apart from its shareholders or members,
It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and

A corporation has perpetual existence,

It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.

In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
British Columbia:  A Representation Agreement concerning personal care decisions can be made under the Representation Agreement Act. Also, an Advance Directive, covering health care decisions, can be made under the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act.
Manitoba:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives Act.
New Brunswick:  Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care which includes decisions about health care can be created under the Infirm Persons Act.
Newfoundland and Labrador:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Advance Health Care Directives Act.
Northwest Territories: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
Nova Scotia: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
Nunavut: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills or Powers of Attorney for Personal Care.
Ontario: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care covering personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Substitute Decisions Act.
Prince Edward Island:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be created under the Consent to Treatment and Health Care Directives Act.
Québec:  A Mandate covering personal care, health care and financial decisions can be created under the Québec Civil Code.
Saskatchewan: A Power of Attorney for Personal Care covering personal care decisions, but excluding health care decisions, can be created under The Powers of Attorney Act.  A Health Care Directive covering only health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives and Substitute Health Care Decision Makers Act.
Yukon: Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Care Consent Act.

 
Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.
For more information on Wills, visit your provincial or territorial government.

Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
British Columbia:  A Representation Agreement concerning personal care decisions can be made under the Representation Agreement Act. Also, an Advance Directive, covering health care decisions, can be made under the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act.
Manitoba:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives Act.
New Brunswick:  Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care which includes decisions about health care can be created under the Infirm Persons Act.
Newfoundland and Labrador:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Advance Health Care Directives Act.

Prince Edward Island:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be created under the Consent to Treatment and Health Care Directives Act.
Québec:  A Mandate covering personal care, health care and financial decisions can be created under the Québec Civil Code.
Saskatchewan: A Power of Attorney for Personal Care covering personal care decisions, but excluding health care decisions, can be created under The Powers of Attorney Act.  A Health Care Directive covering only health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives and Substitute Health Care Decision Makers Act.
Yukon: Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Care Consent Act.

 
Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.
For more information on Wills, visit your provincial or territorial government.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","

Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

Find a Lawyer or Paralegal,"Lawyers, paralegals, and notaries public",864,"
				A lawyer is a licensed professional entitled to draw up legal documents, offer legal advice and opinions, and prosecute or defend people in law courts. Generally speaking, a paralegal is a paraprofessional who has the required education and experience to assist licensed lawyers in their legal work.  One of the most important differences between a lawyer and a paralegal is that a lawyer can give legal advice.  Also, while lawyers can represent clients in any legal issue, paralegals can only represent clients in limited situations.
In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine","

In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine”.
Notaries public are governed by their provincial or territorial notaries acts. Unlike lawyers and paralegals, they do not have to undergo special education or training, and a notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers may work for private law firms, legal aid, as Crown prosecutors, or in offices at the federal, provincial and municipal level of government, as well as for businesses.
Lawyers must complete years of university education and practical training. Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society. In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer). They are governed by their provincial Law Society which establishes and enforces standards of conduct, credentials, education and client protection that all lawyers must meet to practice law.
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

 
Paralegals
Formerly referred to as a “Legal Assistant”, paralegals usually have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes at a community college. They are capable of independent legal work, performed subject to the general supervision of a lawyer. A paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance.
An unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the practice of law. Usually, paralegals prepare legal documents, maintain records and files and conduct research to assist lawyers or other professionals. Independent paralegals provide legal services to the public as allowed by government legislation, or provide paralegal services on contract to law firms or other establishments. Specific job titles associated with paralegals include:

corporate paralegal
family law paralegal
independent paralegal
senior paralegal
litigation paralegal
land titles examiner
legal technician
legal assistant
legal researcher
notary public
law clerk
title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
The procedure to become a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits, differs by province and territory. In Ontario, you must complete an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. In Manitoba, the application is made with the Minister of Finance, and in Alberta, notary public appointments are made by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
For help in deciding whether a lawyer or a paralegal is the right professional for your situation, visit your provincial or territorial Law Society. For more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits contact your provincial government office.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to the negligence or misdeeds of professionals in their work. Included in this category are doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and can be expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the stand","

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practises, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service required and the type of professional providing it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, before administering any kind of medical treatment, medical practitioners have an obligation to advise the patient fully of associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has are based on the law and written guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing a full medical history to your doctor or telling the truth about the case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession.
For example, if your complaint is with a medical doctor, you may contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Québec it is the Collège des médecins du Québec; in Yukon, the Yukon Medical Council; Health and Social Services in the Northwest Territories; and Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavut. Visit Health Law for links to the applicable medical organization where you live.
If your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants where you live. Visit Business Law for a link.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Types of mutual funds
The types of funds and what they invest in include:

Money market – Short-term fixed income securities like treasury bills
Fixed income – Fixed income securities like government bonds and corporate bonds
Growth or equity – Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced – A mix of equities and fixed income securities
Global – Foreign equities or fixed income securities
Specialty – Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index – Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from your provincial or territorial financial securities commission.

All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from your provincial or territorial financial securities commission.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),What is a structured settlement?,486,"
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For","
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
 
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfills the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable, and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The “guarantee period” may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. Funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or his or her agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first, and then purchase a structured settlement annuity after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed, leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements you should consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couple","

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				Provincial governments have many rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.

You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (including a single individual) a court believes will honour the best interests of the child. All provinces allow same-sex adoptions. If an adult (someone who has attained the age of majority) is to be adopted, there may be restrictions on who can adopt (usually, only the person or couple who tended to the individual when he or she was a minor).
 
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In most jurisdictions, consent for the adoption will be required from a child over the age of 12. In Quebec, consent is required from a child 10 years old and older.  In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Depending on the province, the child must be a certain number of days old before written permission for adoption can be given, such as seven days in Ontario and Newfoundland. In British Columbia, consent cannot be given until the baby is 10 days old. Again, depending on the province, there is also a time period in which the natural parents can change their minds and cancel the permission. For instance, in British Columbia and Quebec, a birth mother can withdraw her consent within 30 days of the child’s birth, while in Ontario, the mother has 21 days. If permission is cancelled within the prescribed period, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the period has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their minds about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents’ consent.
How to adopt a child
There are generally two common ways to adopt a child, depending on the province: public adoption and private adoption. Public adoption is through a local Children’s Aid Society, provincial Child Welfare office, or similar public agency. To adopt a child through a public agency, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved, the agency will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the court gives the adoption order.
The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licensed by a provincial government. The process is very similar to going through the public agency. Note that there are no provincial caps on adoption fees, which can range from $6,000 to $25,000.
Regardless of what province or territory they live in, generally, every potential adoptive parent must complete a homestudy, sometimes called a family assessment, conducted by a social worker through visits to the home, to make sure the adoption is suitable for the parents and the child. In most cases, the home study includes an educational component to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child.
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, in most cases, you do not need to go through a public or private adoption agency, but you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order.
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 – Adopting a child from abroad.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For more information on the adoption process and laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

What is ’cause’ for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was ’cause’, also known as ‘just cause”. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

 
What is not ’cause’ for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but this wrong does not constitute a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee’s work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations,
Public foundations, and
Private foundations.

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
 
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public’s perspective.
 
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to","
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on “Marriage Contracts,” the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
 
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
 
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if a court ordered the terms of the separation agreement. If you are concerned your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the agreement, file it with your provincial government. This will help enforce any schedule of payments under it. Responsibility for enforcing registered agreements in most provinces comes under the Justice or Attorney General’s ministry or department.   You can also file an agreement with the family law court in your province. Most provinces have enforcement agencies.
For example, in British Columbia, it is called the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program. In New Brunswick, it is the Family Support Orders Service. In Nova Scotia it is the Maintenance Enforcement Program; and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it is the Support Enforcement Program.
 
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important so each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements, refer to your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or ‘certified’ by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant’s costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.

For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.
If you require legal assistance with regard to a child support order, you should consult a lawyer.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","

There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

				Many people change their name when they get married, as well as for other personal or professional reasons. Each province and territory has different procedures involving changing a person’s name, depending on their age and the circumstances under which they want it changed.
Generally, there are four ways to change your name:

You can assume your spouse’s surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.
You can legally change your surname based on marital status. The right to change one’s surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.

You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.
You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.
To find out the rules and steps to change your name, visit your provincial government Vital Statistics office.

Nova Scotia Collection Agencies Act
Nunavut Consumer Protection Act
Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.

Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount is within the limits of your province. Or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort, and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor’s assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor’s assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means you can take possession of the asset, sell it and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to ensure your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business, contact your local government. For legal advice, consult a lawyer.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”

“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.

Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.

What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.


Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Criminal Law,What is a criminal record?,793,"
				Not all dealings with the police result in a criminal record. For example,if the police give you a parking ticket, this is an offence under a municipal by-law and is not considered criminal. If you are charged with a provincial driving offence, such as making an improper lane change, this is an offence under provincial traffic legislation and is not criminal.

This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.
For more information about removing a criminal record, call the Pardons Canada telephone support line, toll-free at 1-877-929-6011 or in Toronto at 416-929-6011, or visit their website at www.pardons.org.

Real Estate Law,What are condominiums?,0413,"
				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"
				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver’s Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

 1. Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can claim a security or lien on a debtor’s specific asset, usually the item you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor.
A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

Internet and Cyber Law,Cyberbullying,363,"
				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say.","

People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP’s Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts’ willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go “forum shopping”. Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

Harassment is also a form of discrimination. Harassment means that the ‘harasser’ acts in an annoying or abusive manner that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the other person.
Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.
For more information, access your local human rights laws, or if your case is federal, the Canadian Human Rights Act.

Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.
				Was your question answered?
			When two people live together in a conjugal relationship and are not married, they may be considered to be living in a common-law relationship. If you are living in a common-law relationship, you will have a number of rights and obligations arising under family law, tax law, welfare and family benefits, and employee benefit plans. Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.
Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				Provincial governments have many rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.

To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (including a single individual) a court believes will honour the best interests of the child. All provinces allow same-sex adoptions. If an adult (someone who has attained the age of majority) is to be adopted, there may be restrictions on who can adopt (usually, only the person or couple who tended to the individual when he or she was a minor).
 
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In most jurisdictions, consent for the adoption will be required from a child over the age of 12. In Quebec, consent is required from a child 10 years old and older.  In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Depending on the province, the child must be a certain number of days old before written permission for adoption can be given, such as seven days in Ontario and Newfoundland. In British Columbia, consent cannot be given until the baby is 10 days old. Again, depending on the province, there is also a time period in which the natural parents can change their minds and cancel the permission. For instance, in British Columbia and Quebec, a birth mother can withdraw her consent within 30 days of the child’s birth, while in Ontario, the mother has 21 days. If permission is cancelled within the prescribed period, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the period has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their minds about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents’ consent.
How to adopt a child
There are generally two common ways to adopt a child, depending on the province: public adoption and private adoption. Public adoption is through a local Children’s Aid Society, provincial Child Welfare office, or similar public agency. To adopt a child through a public agency, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved, the agency will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the court gives the adoption order.
The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licensed by a provincial government. The process is very similar to going through the public agency. Note that there are no provincial caps on adoption fees, which can range from $6,000 to $25,000.
Regardless of what province or territory they live in, generally, every potential adoptive parent must complete a homestudy, sometimes called a family assessment, conducted by a social worker through visits to the home, to make sure the adoption is suitable for the parents and the child. In most cases, the home study includes an educational component to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child.
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, in most cases, you do not need to go through a public or private adoption agency, but you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order.
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 – Adopting a child from abroad.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For more information on the adoption process and laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Defamation: Libel and slander,480,"

The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days. Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.

Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.

In Canada, there are four “heads” or categories of charities:

Relief of poverty

Other purposes beneficial to the community

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations,
Public foundations, and
Private foundations.

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
 
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public’s perspective.
 
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under your provincial corporations act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
Although a corporation may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all provincial tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, your provincial Ministry of Finance will deny the application for dissolution. Therefore, you first must obtain proof from the Ministry of Finance that your corporation is in compliance with the tax laws and does not have any outstanding taxes. Once this is obtained, you can then proceed and your ministry or department responsible for Consumer Affairs can dissolve the corporation. You will likely need to provide copies of your Articles of Incorporation and a fee.

In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch. IX, Division IV), it is called a Mandate.
Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
 
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, thereby ensuring that your personal care will be in the hands of someone you have chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In addition, you may specify your wishes about more than health care. For example, you may have certain dietary restrictions or have determined which facility you prefer to live in should you need long-term care.
In British Columbia, the Representation Agreement Act also allows you to give your representative the authority over  the routine management of your financial affairs. In Quebec, the Mandate can contain provisions regarding both the person’s property in addition to their personal care. In Saskatchewan, although the attorney for personal care legislation applies to personal decisions, regarding such things as housing, food, and clothing, it does not apply to health care decisions, which are covered under a different Act. In New Brunswick, both a Power of Attorney for Property and a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can be included in the same document.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will or a Health Directive is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
Although the two are often confused, and, in terms of health care decisions these documents may overlap, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
For example, in Saskatchewan, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can deal with many aspects of someone’s personal care, but cannot deal with health care issues. In comparison, a Living Will sets out only wishes about your health care and not your other personal care decisions. Further, a Living Will does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf, but can simply be general instructions for future health care providers.
Although in many provinces, such as Manitoba, the government has developed a standard form that may be used, a Living Will can be in any written form. A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
To make a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

have reached the age of majority in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan; be at least 16 years of age in Ontario; and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the legislation does not state an age requirement,
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney ?
The person you give this power to may be referred to by one of the following names: attorney, agent, delegate, representative, or mandatary, depending on the province. It is important to note that the term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

have attained the age of majority (18 or 19 years of age depending on the province), except in Ontario where section 44 of the Substitute Decisions Act allows for anyone 16 years of age or older to be named as attorney,
be mentally competent,
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

In some provinces, the legislation precludes bankrupts and those with criminal records from acting as attorneys.
Above all, you should select someone you know well and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, ask that person if he or she is willing to be your attorney. Also, talk about your wishes and that person’s responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly.  You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by one or two witnesses (the number of witnesses required depends on the province).

The witnesses must:

be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
have attained the age of majority,
not be the attorney you appointed, or a spouse or common-law partner of the attorney, your own spouse or partner, your child or generally any person who is a minor.

In the province of Quebec, the Mandate must also be homologated, which means approved by the court.
 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. If it is not prepared correctly, it will not be legal. Given the importance of providing for your personal care, it is advisable to consult a lawyer when drafting a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from your provincial or territorial government.

To make a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

have reached the age of majority in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan; be at least 16 years of age in Ontario; and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the legislation does not state an age requirement,
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney ?
The person you give this power to may be referred to by one of the following names: attorney, agent, delegate, representative, or mandatary, depending on the province. It is important to note that the term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

have attained the age of majority (18 or 19 years of age depending on the province), except in Ontario where section 44 of the Substitute Decisions Act allows for anyone 16 years of age or older to be named as attorney,
be mentally competent,
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

In some provinces, the legislation precludes bankrupts and those with criminal records from acting as attorneys.
Above all, you should select someone you know well and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, ask that person if he or she is willing to be your attorney. Also, talk about your wishes and that person’s responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly.  You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by one or two witnesses (the number of witnesses required depends on the province).

The witnesses must:

be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
have attained the age of majority,
not be the attorney you appointed, or a spouse or common-law partner of the attorney, your own spouse or partner, your child or generally any person who is a minor.

In the province of Quebec, the Mandate must also be homologated, which means approved by the court.
 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. If it is not prepared correctly, it will not be legal. Given the importance of providing for your personal care, it is advisable to consult a lawyer when drafting a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Government and The Justice System,Change your name,716,"
				Many people change their name when they get married, as well as for other personal or professional reasons. Each province and territory has different procedures involving changing a person’s name, depending on their age and the circumstances under which they want it changed.
Generally, there are four ways to change your name:

You can assume your spouse’s surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.
You can legally change your surname based on marital status. The right to change one’s surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.

You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.
You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.
To find out the rules and steps to change your name, visit your provincial government Vital Statistics office.

Family Law,Paternity issues and DNA testing,132,"
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases whe","
				Paternity issues arise when there is a discrepancy as to who the father of a child is. Paternity issues can arise if a man is claiming to be the father of a child and the mother is denying his claim, or if a mother is claiming that a man is the father of her child and he is denying it.
Legal paternity to a non-biological child
Being a parent of a child in law can arise even if the individual is not a biological parent. If a man has demonstrated a settled intention to treat a child as a child of his own family, that man may be deemed to be a parent of that child under provincial family law legislation, even if he is not the biological father of the child. This can also apply to cases where the mother is artificially inseminated and the father later wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage to gain custody or access rights.
How can paternity be tested?
If either party is asserting that the man is the biological father of a child in a civil case, the court, in most cases, may order a blood test to determine parentage. If either the man refuses to submit to the blood test, or the mother refuses to allow the blood test, the court may draw conclusions as it wishes from such a refusal.
How accurate is the testing?
DNA paternity testing through blood tests yields results that indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%. If there is a mismatch between the profiles of the child and the alleged father, the alleged father is 100% excluded from being the child’s father, meaning there is no percentage of error for exclusion.
Are testing and test results legally enforceable?
Although DNA paternity testing is almost 100% accurate, the law is unclear as to what the legal force of a blood test is in determining paternity. However, the test results can be submitted to the court as evidence for presumption of paternity in a civil proceeding. How the paternity test will affect a case will vary on a case by case basis.
The rights and obligations if a man is found to be the father of a child
If a man is found to be the father of a child, the law imposes certain obligations and affords certain rights to the father. The law provides that every parent has an obligation to provide support for his or her unmarried child who is a minor, or who is enrolled in a full time program of education, to the extent that the parent is capable of doing so. A parent need not support a child of 16, 17 or 18 years of age or older, depending on the province, if the child has withdrawn from parental control. The amount of child support to be provided by a parent will be determined by federal and provincial government guidelines and the courts. The father of a child may also be entitled to custody and access rights.
For assistance with a paternity case, you should consult a family law lawyer.

Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.

Yukon: Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Care Consent Act.

 
Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.

				Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities.

A corporation has perpetual existence,
It exists separate and apart from its shareholders or members,

In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.
				Was your question answered?
			Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,
It exists separate and apart from its shareholders or members,
It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Investments and Securities,Mutual funds,283,"

Index – Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from your provincial or territorial financial securities commission.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to the negligence or misdeeds of professionals in their work. Included in this category are doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and can be expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the stand","

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practises, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service required and the type of professional providing it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, before administering any kind of medical treatment, medical practitioners have an obligation to advise the patient fully of associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has are based on the law and written guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing a full medical history to your doctor or telling the truth about the case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession.
For example, if your complaint is with a medical doctor, you may contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Québec it is the Collège des médecins du Québec; in Yukon, the Yukon Medical Council; Health and Social Services in the Northwest Territories; and Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavut. Visit Health Law for links to the applicable medical organization where you live.
If your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants where you live. Visit Business Law for a link.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Property?,157,"
				 
A Power of Attorney for Property (or Finances) is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills. The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer.

The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.
 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The type of things your attorney can do depend entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney  that covers all your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do and when. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future or upon a specific occurrence, then you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a Continuing Power of Attorney, or Enduring Power of Attorney. This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, check with a lawyer to determine if the document still applies should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property ?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. Generally, to give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

have reached the age of majority,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who has reached the age of majority and who is mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a bank or trust company. Often people choose financial institutions because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be set out in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign the Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include: the attorney you are appointing, the attorney’s spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child, or any person who  is a minor, which means under the age of majority.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. Considering that the management of your finances is at stake, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer for legal assistance.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Having said that however, for practical purposes, any record held at a government office, containing information about a person’s criminal activity or involvement is considered to be a type of criminal record. This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.

Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada’s Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, visit CBSA.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Regional Business Service Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

Business Law,Extending credit and credit checks,229,"
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,","
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver’s Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

 1. Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can claim a security or lien on a debtor’s specific asset, usually the item you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor.
A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.

				Was your question answered?
			The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

Lawyers may work for private law firms, legal aid, as Crown prosecutors, or in offices at the federal, provincial and municipal level of government, as well as for businesses.
Lawyers must complete years of university education and practical training. Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society. In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer). They are governed by their provincial Law Society which establishes and enforces standards of conduct, credentials, education and client protection that all lawyers must meet to practice law.
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

 
Paralegals
Formerly referred to as a “Legal Assistant”, paralegals usually have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes at a community college. They are capable of independent legal work, performed subject to the general supervision of a lawyer. A paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance.
An unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the practice of law. Usually, paralegals prepare legal documents, maintain records and files and conduct research to assist lawyers or other professionals. Independent paralegals provide legal services to the public as allowed by government legislation, or provide paralegal services on contract to law firms or other establishments. Specific job titles associated with paralegals include:

corporate paralegal
family law paralegal
independent paralegal
senior paralegal
litigation paralegal
land titles examiner
legal technician
legal assistant
legal researcher
notary public
law clerk
title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
The procedure to become a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits, differs by province and territory. In Ontario, you must complete an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. In Manitoba, the application is made with the Minister of Finance, and in Alberta, notary public appointments are made by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
For help in deciding whether a lawyer or a paralegal is the right professional for your situation, visit your provincial or territorial Law Society. For more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits contact your provincial government office.
				Was your question answered?
			A lawyer is a licensed professional entitled to draw up legal documents, offer legal advice and opinions, and prosecute or defend people in law courts. Generally speaking, a paralegal is a paraprofessional who has the required education and experience to assist licensed lawyers in their legal work.  One of the most important differences between a lawyer and a paralegal is that a lawyer can give legal advice.  Also, while lawyers can represent clients in any legal issue, paralegals can only represent clients in limited situations.
In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine”.
Notaries public are governed by their provincial or territorial notaries acts. Unlike lawyers and paralegals, they do not have to undergo special education or training, and a notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

				What is considered trafficking?

“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.

Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.

What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.


Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to the negligence or misdeeds of professionals in their work. Included in this category are doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and can be expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the stand","

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practises, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service required and the type of professional providing it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, before administering any kind of medical treatment, medical practitioners have an obligation to advise the patient fully of associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has are based on the law and written guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing a full medical history to your doctor or telling the truth about the case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession.
For example, if your complaint is with a medical doctor, you may contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Québec it is the Collège des médecins du Québec; in Yukon, the Yukon Medical Council; Health and Social Services in the Northwest Territories; and Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavut. Visit Health Law for links to the applicable medical organization where you live.
If your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants where you live. Visit Business Law for a link.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch.

				A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your personal care should you become unable to make these decisions yourself.
Only eight provinces have laws for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Also, this document is known by different names depending on the province. In British Columbia, it is called a Representation Agreement, in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Northwest Territories it is called a Personal Directive, in New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan it is called a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and in Quebec (ch. IX, Division IV), it is called a Mandate.
Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
 
Purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care
The main purpose of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care is to give you control and peace of mind. It lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, thereby ensuring that your personal care will be in the hands of someone you have chosen, as opposed to someone appointed by the court.
It also gives you a chance to determine the kind of care you may or may not want. For example, you may want to specifically request a certain kind of medical treatment over another. In addition, you may specify your wishes about more than health care. For example, you may have certain dietary restrictions or have determined which facility you prefer to live in should you need long-term care.
In British Columbia, the Representation Agreement Act also allows you to give your representative the authority over  the routine management of your financial affairs. In Quebec, the Mandate can contain provisions regarding both the person’s property in addition to their personal care. In Saskatchewan, although the attorney for personal care legislation applies to personal decisions, regarding such things as housing, food, and clothing, it does not apply to health care decisions, which are covered under a different Act. In New Brunswick, both a Power of Attorney for Property and a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can be included in the same document.
 
Difference between a Power of Attorney for Personal Care and a Living Will
A Living Will or a Health Directive is a document that expresses whether and how you want to be kept alive by medical machines if there is little hope of your recovery. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
Although the two are often confused, and, in terms of health care decisions these documents may overlap, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety.
For example, in Saskatchewan, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care can deal with many aspects of someone’s personal care, but cannot deal with health care issues. In comparison, a Living Will sets out only wishes about your health care and not your other personal care decisions. Further, a Living Will does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf, but can simply be general instructions for future health care providers.
Although in many provinces, such as Manitoba, the government has developed a standard form that may be used, a Living Will can be in any written form. A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
To make a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you must:

have reached the age of majority in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan; be at least 16 years of age in Ontario; and in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the legislation does not state an age requirement,
have the capacity to understand what authority you are giving your attorney, and the consequences.

 
Who can be appointed as an attorney ?
The person you give this power to may be referred to by one of the following names: attorney, agent, delegate, representative, or mandatary, depending on the province. It is important to note that the term attorney means someone who is representing you, and making decisions on your behalf, it does not mean that they are a lawyer. Usually your attorney is your spouse, a relative or a close friend.
The attorney you appoint must:

have attained the age of majority (18 or 19 years of age depending on the province), except in Ontario where section 44 of the Substitute Decisions Act allows for anyone 16 years of age or older to be named as attorney,
be mentally competent,
not be someone who is being paid to provide you with health care, residential, social, training, or support services. If a person is being paid to provide you with any of these services, they can only be your attorney if they are also your spouse, common-law spouse, same-sex partner, or relative.

In some provinces, the legislation precludes bankrupts and those with criminal records from acting as attorneys.
Above all, you should select someone you know well and trust to follow your instructions or wishes. Before you make your decision, ask that person if he or she is willing to be your attorney. Also, talk about your wishes and that person’s responsibilities.
You can appoint more than one attorney to make decisions jointly.  You can also name an alternate to step in if the main attorney is unable to act for any reason.
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Personal Care
To be legal, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care needs to be:

in writing,
signed by you in the presence of witnesses,
signed by one or two witnesses (the number of witnesses required depends on the province).

The witnesses must:

be present when you sign your Power of Attorney,
have attained the age of majority,
not be the attorney you appointed, or a spouse or common-law partner of the attorney, your own spouse or partner, your child or generally any person who is a minor.

In the province of Quebec, the Mandate must also be homologated, which means approved by the court.
 
Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care enforceable in another province ?
Legislation in all of the eight provinces that allows for the creation of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, will consider a Power of Attorney made in another province to be valid and enforceable if it was made in the manner prescribed under their own Act. Practically speaking, this can be tricky because there are several variations in laws, such as different age requirements, what matters can be decided by the attorney, and the number of witnesses required to make it legal. If you move provinces, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and create a new document.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. If it is not prepared correctly, it will not be legal. Given the importance of providing for your personal care, it is advisable to consult a lawyer when drafting a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
More information about Powers of Attorney can also be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Business Law,Not-for-profit organizations,237,"
				Not-for-profit organizations, also known as ‘non-profit’ organizations in some provinces and territories, and as a ‘society’ in British Columbia, can be unincorporated associations or incorporated entities. A not-for-profit corporation is similar to a for-profit corporation in the following five ways:

A corporation has perpetual existence,

It may hold real estate in its own name,
It can sue, be sued and contract in its own name as a separate entity, and
In most cases, individual shareholders or members of a corporation are exempt from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the corporation.

The three main differences between for-profit and not-for-profit corporations are:

Not-for-profit corporations are without share capital and have members rather than shareholders,
In a not-for-profit corporation the members are prohibited from receiving any financial gain, and
Not-for-profit corporations must be established for purposes other than gain for their members. The stated purposes for establishing the corporation are set out in a Letters Patent and may be referred to as the “objects” or goals of the corporation. A not-for-profit corporation can have either charitable objects or non-charitable objects.

Provincial not-for-profit corporations
Not-for-profit corporations are incorporated by filing incorporation documents, usually called Articles of Incorporation or Letters Patent. The provincial registration of a not-for-profit corporation may be withheld when incorporation is considered not to be in the public interest. As with any other type of corporation, a not-for-profit corporation must have by-laws which provide the framework for democratic decision-making and which set out the rules of how business will be conducted. The by-laws also set out the rights and obligations of the corporation members.
Provincial incorporation rules for not-for-profit corporations are set out in either the provincial Corporations Act (which also governs for-profit corporations), or in a separate Act dedicated to not-for-profit corporations.

Federal not-for-profit corporations
If a not-for-profit corporation is incorporated federally, under the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (NFP Act) it will be incorporated using Articles of Incorporation. Not-for-profit corporations incorporated under previous federal laws will have to file a “certificate of continuance” to avoid dissolution. The new federal Act adds a new set of modernized and flexible rules for creating, organizing and maintaining a not-for-profit corporation in Canada.
Under the NFP Act, rather than Letters Patent, corporations will be incorporated pursuant to Articles of Incorporation. It will not longer be necessary to submit a draft form of the by-laws along with the application for Articles of Incorporation. As well, the corporation will no longer be required to have “objects”. If, however, the corporation is a charity, it will likely continue to be desirable to include them. And finally, it will no longer be necessary to list the powers of the corporation. The NFP Act will allow for the incorporation of a corporation as a numbered company. For more information, visit Corporations Canada.

Board of directors
Generally, a board of a non-profit entity must have a minimum of three directors. The persons named as the first directors in the incorporation documents remain the directors of the corporation until they are replaced by the same number of people appointed or elected in their place. Members elect the directors of a not-for-profit corporation. In turn, directors must elect a president from among themselves. The directors must also appoint a secretary and may appoint vice-presidents and other officers, all of whom do not need to be directors. The appointment, remuneration, functions, duties, and removal of officers are governed by the corporation’s by-laws.
Members
In addition to directors and officers, every not-for-profit corporation must have members. Each member who signs the application for incorporation becomes a member as of the date of incorporation. Although there is no limit on the number of members of a not-for-profit corporation, generally, there must not be fewer than three. After incorporation, the directors may admit others to membership.
Membership in a not-for-profit corporation is generally not transferable and therefore ceases to exist upon the death, resignation, or expulsion of a member. There may be more than one class of membership and members may be natural persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations.
A not-for-profit corporation is not allowed to pay dividends to its members and no member can receive any profit or gain from the corporation because it must be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members. Any profits must be used in the promotion of the activities of the corporation.
Auditor and records
To legally run a not-for-profit corporation, members must appoint an auditor annually and keep proper accounting records with respect to all financial and other transactions. Other required records include books with minutes of all meetings of members and directors, and registers of the members and directors. These records must be kept at the corporation head office and must be available during normal business hours for inspection by the directors.
For additional information on not-for-profit corporations, visit your local government. For information on the differences between a registered charity and a non-profit organization (NPO) and the tax implications, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Incorporation of a not-for-profit company can be quite complicated. For legal assistance, consult a lawyer.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",What is a Power of Attorney for Property?,157,"
				 
A Power of Attorney for Property (or Finances) is a written document in which you give someone the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you become unable to make these decisions yourself. For example, your Attorney for Property could be responsible for taking care of your banking matters, managing your investments, running your business, buying and selling real estate on your behalf, or paying your monthly bills.

The only thing that you could not appoint an attorney to do is to write your will. Although the person you give this power to is called your “attorney,” it does not mean that they are your lawyer. Most often, your attorney is your spouse, a relative, or a close friend.
 
What can your Attorney for Property do?
The type of things your attorney can do depend entirely on how much power you give them. You could give a general Power of Attorney  that covers all your property and financial affairs. Or, you could give a more specific Power of Attorney that allows the attorney to handle only some of your affairs. For example, you could even limit the Power of Attorney to a single real estate transaction while you are out of the country.
You must clearly outline what you are allowing your attorney to do and when. For example, often people wish to prepare a Power of Attorney in case they become unable to take care of certain things as they get older. If you only want your Power of Attorney to take effect at some point in the future or upon a specific occurrence, then you must clearly state this.
How long does your Power of Attorney for Property last?
If you do not limit your Power of Attorney in any way, then it continues to have effect until your death. In fact, you may often hear a Power of Attorney being called a Continuing Power of Attorney, or Enduring Power of Attorney. This means that the Power of Attorney continues to have effect even if you become mentally incompetent. If you have an old Power of Attorney, check with a lawyer to determine if the document still applies should you become mentally incompetent.
Who can give a Power of Attorney for Property ?
There are certain rules about who can give a Power of Attorney for Property, and who can be appointed as an attorney. Generally, to give a Power of Attorney for Property, you must:

have reached the age of majority,
be mentally capable,
be aware of the property you own and its general value,
understand what it means to appoint an attorney,
know what authority you are giving your attorney, and
you must understand the possibility that the attorney could misuse the power you are giving them.

 
Who can be an Attorney for Property?
Your attorney must be someone who has reached the age of majority and who is mentally competent. Although it may be best to select someone who has some knowledge of financial matters, above all, you should select someone you know well and trust.
You can appoint more than one attorney, and you can also name an alternate attorney who would step in if the main attorney was unable to act for some reason. If you are uncomfortable selecting a family member or friend to be your attorney, you may also want to consider selecting a bank or trust company. Often people choose financial institutions because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be set out in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign the Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include: the attorney you are appointing, the attorney’s spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child, or any person who  is a minor, which means under the age of majority.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. Considering that the management of your finances is at stake, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer for legal assistance.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Often people choose financial institutions because they are professional and impartial.
 
Requirements for a valid Power of Attorney for Property
To be legal, a Power of Attorney needs to be set out in writing, and signed by you and two witnesses. The two witnesses must both be present when you sign the Power of Attorney. People who the law does not allow to be witnesses include: the attorney you are appointing, the attorney’s spouse or partner, your own spouse or partner, your child, or any person who  is a minor, which means under the age of majority.
Drafting a Power of Attorney involves a number of technical legal details. It can also cause many problems if it is not done correctly. Considering that the management of your finances is at stake, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer for legal assistance.
More information about Powers of Attorney can be found from your provincial or territorial government.

Provincial Social Assistance and Disability Support Programs
If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.
For more information or to apply for benefits, contact your local government office.
 
Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships: where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations: which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and employment insurance contributions from the employees’ paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer’s legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
 
Special considerations for home businesses

1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence. In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
 
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public’s perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person’s home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues that arise with a home business can be very complicated, you should consult a lawyer for assistance and advice.
For more information about operating a business, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

"Wills, Estates and Powers of Attorney",Living Wills,160,"
				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.

				A Living Will, also known as an Advance Directive, or Health Directive, is a document that allows you to leave instructions about your future medical treatment, should you become incapable of doing so at a later date.  It can take effect if you become incapacitated by illness, injury, or old age.
In particular, a Living Will lets you decide whether you want to be kept alive by medical machines if it is unlikely that you will recover. In it, a person will generally indicate what type of treatment they are willing to undergo, and at what point they would like medical treatments to be discontinued.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care ?
Although the two are often confused, a Living Will is not the same as a Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Although called by different names, such as Representation Agreements, or Personal Directives, a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, available under the laws of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Québec and Saskatchewan, is a legal document in which you name a specific person to make personal care decisions on your behalf. Depending on the province, personal care can include decisions about health care, medical treatment, diet, shelter, clothing, hygiene, social activities, support services, routine management of your financial affairs, legal matters, and safety. In contrast, a Living Will sets out only your wishes about your health care and it does not need to name anyone to act on your behalf.
A Living Will can be a stand-alone document, or can be included as part of a Power of Attorney for Personal Care.
 
Is a Living Will the same as a Will ?
Even though it is called a Living Will, it is not the same as a Will. A Will is a legal document that you create in order to deal with your assets and the custody of minor children in the event of your death. A Will does not take effect until the person dies, whereas a Living Will is only in effect when the maker is alive, and only deals with health care decisions.
 
How to make a Living Will
Living Wills are known by different names in the various provinces across Canada. Some governments have provided forms that can be used to make a Living Will, while others do not. A Living Will can include anything the person wishes provided that it is not prohibited by law, or that it does not omit anything that is required by law. For example, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are illegal and will not be enforceable if included.
In addition, a Living Will must be in writing, dated, and signed by the maker in the presence of witnesses. Generally, any adult can act as a witness provided that he or she:

is not providing personal care, health care or financial services to the maker for compensation,
is not a spouse, child, parent, employee or agent of the maker.

If there is a prior Living Will in existence, you should have a statement revoking it. If you wish to appoint an agent or proxy to carry out your wishes, he or she should be named. If you appoint more than one agent or proxy it is a good idea to speak with them first to ensure that they are willing to act on your behalf and that they can work together to carry-out your wishes. You can also appoint a substitute agent in case your agent is not capable of acting on your behalf. Clear statements, as to your wishes, including medical procedures, should be set out. It is also important to decide when the Living Will is to take effect. It can be at the occurrence of a specific event, or if you are in a particular circumstance. Finally, your Living Will should state that you are of age to make the document and that you have the mentally capacity to do so.
The following is a list of the Living Will or Power of Attorney for Personal Care documents available in each province, and the law under which the document can be created.

Alberta: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care decisions including health care can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
British Columbia:  A Representation Agreement concerning personal care decisions can be made under the Representation Agreement Act. Also, an Advance Directive, covering health care decisions, can be made under the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act.
Manitoba:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives Act.
New Brunswick:  Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care which includes decisions about health care can be created under the Infirm Persons Act.
Newfoundland and Labrador:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Advance Health Care Directives Act.
Northwest Territories: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
Nova Scotia: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Personal Directive, which includes personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Personal Directives Act.
Nunavut: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills or Powers of Attorney for Personal Care.
Ontario: Does not have legislation specifically for Living Wills. A Power of Attorney for Personal Care covering personal care and health care decisions can be made under the Substitute Decisions Act.
Prince Edward Island:  Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. A Health Care Directive covering health care decisions can be created under the Consent to Treatment and Health Care Directives Act.
Québec:  A Mandate covering personal care, health care and financial decisions can be created under the Québec Civil Code.
Saskatchewan: A Power of Attorney for Personal Care covering personal care decisions, but excluding health care decisions, can be created under The Powers of Attorney Act.  A Health Care Directive covering only health care decisions can be made under The Health Care Directives and Substitute Health Care Decision Makers Act.
Yukon: Does not have legislation specifically for Powers of Attorney for Personal Care. An Advance Directive covering health care decisions can be made under the Care Consent Act.

 
Is a Living Will or Health Directive enforceable ?
A Living Will may not be binding. Although a Living Will, whether as a stand-alone document or part of Power of Attorney is a legally enforceable document is unclear. In many cases, where someone in the family has strong objections to the wishes set out in the Living Will, such as for medical treatment to be discontinued, those wishes may not actually be carried out. Having said that, there have been cases where the court has determined that the Living Will is enforceable notwithstanding objections from the family. At the very least, a Living Will can be very helpful to give direction to your family members and medical practitioners.
If you would like to leave certain instructions for your health or medical care should you become unable to do so later, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer about making a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, and / or a Living Will.
For more information on Wills, visit your provincial or territorial government.

Investments and Securities,Mutual funds,283,"
				A mutual fund is one type of professionally managed collective investment vehicle. Mutual funds raise money by selling its shares or units to individual investors. The fund then uses this pool of money to purchase a variety of investments. Sometimes mutual funds are referred to as investment companies. Mutual funds are regulated by the securities industry. Further, in most cases, shares in the mutual fund can be bought or sold at any time.

Further, in most cases, shares in the mutual fund can be bought or sold at any time.
 
Types of mutual funds
The types of funds and what they invest in include:

Money market – Short-term fixed income securities like treasury bills
Fixed income – Fixed income securities like government bonds and corporate bonds
Growth or equity – Equities like stocks or income trust units
Balanced – A mix of equities and fixed income securities
Global – Foreign equities or fixed income securities
Specialty – Equities or fixed income securities in a specific region (for example, Asia) or sector (for example, information technology), and
Index – Equities or fixed income securities chosen to mimic a specific index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index


Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from your provincial or territorial financial securities commission.

Advantages of mutual funds
As an investment, mutual funds offer three main advantages.
1. Professional management
First, mutual funds provide an affordable way for individual investors to benefit from professional investment management, because the cost of managing the fund is shared amongst all the investors.
2. Easy way to diversity investment
Second, mutual funds are an easy and low-cost way for individual investors to diversify their investment portfolio. All investments come with some risk, but by purchasing several investments and diversifying your investment portfolio, you can lower your overall investment risk. For individual investors to diversify on their own can be expensive. But because mutual funds represent ownership in a wide variety of investments, buying shares in a mutual fund will help an investor diversify their investment portfolio and minimize their overall investment risk at a relatively low cost.
3. Liquidity
Third, most mutual funds are very liquid investments. It is fairly easy for investors to buy or sell mutual fund units. There are a wide variety of mutual funds available. You can contact an investment advisor for more information about what mutual funds are available. An investment advisor can also help you to determine which funds meet your investment objectives.
More information about investing can also be found from your provincial or territorial financial securities commission.

Seniors and the Law,Canada Pension Plan benefits (CPP),727,"
				The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a benefit plan for retired workers to protect them and their family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. The Plan is administered by the federal Department of Employment and Social Development Canada through Service Canada.
 
Types of Canada Pension Plan benefits
There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at leas","

There are three kinds of CPP benefits:

Disability benefits: available to people who have made contributions to the CPP, and whose disability prevents them from working at any job on a regular basis (includes benefits for disabled contributors and benefits for their dependent children);
Retirement pension: available to individuals who have worked, have made at least one payment to the CPP, and are at least 60 years old; and
Survivor benefits: paid to a deceased contributor’s estate, surviving spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. Survivor benefits include a death benefit, the survivor’s pension and the children’s benefit.

 
Who can receive Canada Pension Plan benefits?
Workers who have contributed to the CPP are eligible for benefits when they retire. The amount of benefits that someone is eligible for will depend on how long the person or their spouse worked and paid into the plan. Generally, workers pay a portion of their wages into the CPP fund until they retire. The amount an individual pays is based on their salary. If they are self-employed, it is based on their net business income (after expenses).
CPP benefits are usually paid to workers when they retire at the age of 65. If a worker retires earlier, between the ages of 60 and 65, they may still be eligible for benefits, although the benefit amount may be reduced. If the worker dies, the benefits may be paid to the worker’s spouse. If the worker becomes disabled and can no longer work, the CPP may begin paying benefits before the worker turns 65.
To start receiving benefits when you retire, you will need to fill out an application form available online, or from a Service Canada Centre in your area. You can also request that a form be mailed to you. To complete an application in person you will need to provide a proof of age document, such as a birth certificate.
 
Changes to the Canada Pension Plan
There are six main changes to the CPP. It is important to note that if a person started receiving a CPP retirement pension before December 31, 2010, and remained out of the work force, they will not be affected by these changes. The changes are as follows:

The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will increase by a higher percentage if taken after age 65.
The monthly CPP retirement pension amount will decrease by a larger percentage if taken before age 65.
A longer period of low earnings will be automatically dropped from the calculation of the CPP retirement pension.
Contributors will be able to receive their CPP retirement pension without any work interruption.
If you are under 65 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you and your employer will have to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.
If you are between the ages of 65 and 70 and you work while receiving your CPP retirement pension, you can choose to continue making CPP contributions. These contributions will increase your CPP benefits.

 
Who do the CPP changes affect?
These changes will affect:

employees making contributions to the CPP, whether they are just starting their career or are planning to retire soon;
self-employed people who contribute to the CPP;
people between the ages of 60 and 70 who work while receiving their CPP retirement pension;
employers who contribute to the CPP on behalf of their employees.

More detailed information on the changes to the Canada Pension Plan can be found from Employment and Social Development Canada.
Provincial Pension Plans
Only Ontario has both federal and provincial pension plans. In May 2015, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Act, 2015 received Royal Assent. Through this law, the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP), will be introduced in Ontario in 2017.
Quebec pensions are not administered by CPP, instead it has its own plan, called the Quebec Pension Plan. For more information, visit rrq.gouv.qc.ca.

Family Law,Separation agreements,105,"
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on “Marriage Contracts,” the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
 
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
 
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if a court ordered the terms of the separation agreement. If you are concerned your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the agreement, file it with your provincial government. This will help enforce any schedule of payments under it. Responsibility for enforcing registered agreements in most provinces comes under the Justice or Attorney General’s ministry or department.   You can also file an agreement with the family law court in your province. Most provinces have enforcement agencies.
For example, in British Columbia, it is called the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program. In New Brunswick, it is the Family Support Orders Service. In Nova Scotia it is the Maintenance Enforcement Program; and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it is the Support Enforcement Program.
 
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important so each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements, refer to your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				Canada’s Anti-terrorism Act, 2015 (the Act) received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015.
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

				Was your question answered?
			Canada’s Anti-terrorism Act, 2015 (the Act) received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015.
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new law. Some people believe it infringes the individual’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Definitions under the new Act are quite broad and as a result there is great uncertainty as to what is considered dissension and acts of terrorism. It is feared that Canadians will lose their right to voice their opinions and their right to protest. Others are unsure just how effective it will be in keeping Canada safe. The Government, however, says that the Act is meant to reflect it’s commitment to the safety of all Canadians, while at the same time, respect and promote our rights as stated in the Charter.
Purpose of the Act
The Act is intended as a tool that increases the powers of law enforcement and national security agencies to stop those who engage in terrorist threats. In addition, the Act has made significant changes to Canada’s national security and privacy laws, including: the Criminal Code of Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Secure Air Travel Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act.
This legislation is intended to prevent terrorism, by:
1. Stopping the promotion of terrorism

 A new criminal offence was created that criminalizes the advocacy or promotion of the commission of terrorism offences.
The new law provides witnesses, and other participants in national security proceedings and prosecutions, with additional protection.

2. Preventing terrorists from using Canada as a recruiting ground

The new Security of Canada Information Sharing Act enables the responsible sharing of relevant national security information across federal departments and agencies.
New laws broaden the scope of the Passenger Protect Program, and are intended to prevent people, who are travelling for the purpose of engaging in terrorism-related activities, from flying.
The Act gives courts the authority to order the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist propaganda material, and the removal of terrorist propaganda from Canadian websites.

3. Disrupting terrorist plots and preventing planned attacks on Canadian soil

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has been given the ability to intervene against specific terrorist plots.
The new laws increase the authority of police forces to temporarily detain people suspected of being terrorists, and toughens penalties for suspects who violate court-ordered conditions.
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act make it is easier for the Government to prevent people who pose a threat to Canadians, and who are not citizens, to enter and remain in Canada.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Employment Law,What is wrongful dismissal?,606,"
				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed. However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you. If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.

If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.
 
What is ’cause’ for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was ’cause’, also known as ‘just cause”. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

 
What is not ’cause’ for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but this wrong does not constitute a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee’s work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.
More information on termination of employment may also be found from your provincial or territorial Ministry of Labour.  In Quebec, visit the Standards Commission, equity, health and safety at work (CNESST).

Business Law,Contracts,242,"
				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
 
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfills the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable, and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The “guarantee period” may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. Funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or his or her agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first, and then purchase a structured settlement annuity after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed, leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements you should consult a lawyer.

			Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.

Types of charities
In Canada, there are four “heads” or categories of charities:

Relief of poverty
Advancement of education
Advancement of religion
Other purposes beneficial to the community

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.

In Canada, there are four “heads” or categories of charities:

Relief of poverty

Other purposes beneficial to the community

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations,
Public foundations, and
Private foundations.

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
 
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public’s perspective.
 
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Real Estate Law,What are condominiums?,0413,"
				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or ‘certified’ by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant’s costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.

Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				Provincial governments have many rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.

You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (including a single individual) a court believes will honour the best interests of the child. All provinces allow same-sex adoptions. If an adult (someone who has attained the age of majority) is to be adopted, there may be restrictions on who can adopt (usually, only the person or couple who tended to the individual when he or she was a minor).
 
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In most jurisdictions, consent for the adoption will be required from a child over the age of 12. In Quebec, consent is required from a child 10 years old and older.  In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Depending on the province, the child must be a certain number of days old before written permission for adoption can be given, such as seven days in Ontario and Newfoundland. In British Columbia, consent cannot be given until the baby is 10 days old. Again, depending on the province, there is also a time period in which the natural parents can change their minds and cancel the permission. For instance, in British Columbia and Quebec, a birth mother can withdraw her consent within 30 days of the child’s birth, while in Ontario, the mother has 21 days. If permission is cancelled within the prescribed period, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the period has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their minds about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents’ consent.
How to adopt a child
There are generally two common ways to adopt a child, depending on the province: public adoption and private adoption. Public adoption is through a local Children’s Aid Society, provincial Child Welfare office, or similar public agency. To adopt a child through a public agency, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved, the agency will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the court gives the adoption order.
The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licensed by a provincial government. The process is very similar to going through the public agency. Note that there are no provincial caps on adoption fees, which can range from $6,000 to $25,000.
Regardless of what province or territory they live in, generally, every potential adoptive parent must complete a homestudy, sometimes called a family assessment, conducted by a social worker through visits to the home, to make sure the adoption is suitable for the parents and the child. In most cases, the home study includes an educational component to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child.
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, in most cases, you do not need to go through a public or private adoption agency, but you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order.
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 – Adopting a child from abroad.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For more information on the adoption process and laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

				Was your question answered?
			Provincial governments have many rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (including a single individual) a court believes will honour the best interests of the child. All provinces allow same-sex adoptions. If an adult (someone who has attained the age of majority) is to be adopted, there may be restrictions on who can adopt (usually, only the person or couple who tended to the individual when he or she was a minor).
 
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In most jurisdictions, consent for the adoption will be required from a child over the age of 12. In Quebec, consent is required from a child 10 years old and older.  In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Depending on the province, the child must be a certain number of days old before written permission for adoption can be given, such as seven days in Ontario and Newfoundland. In British Columbia, consent cannot be given until the baby is 10 days old. Again, depending on the province, there is also a time period in which the natural parents can change their minds and cancel the permission. For instance, in British Columbia and Quebec, a birth mother can withdraw her consent within 30 days of the child’s birth, while in Ontario, the mother has 21 days. If permission is cancelled within the prescribed period, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the period has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their minds about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents’ consent.
How to adopt a child
There are generally two common ways to adopt a child, depending on the province: public adoption and private adoption. Public adoption is through a local Children’s Aid Society, provincial Child Welfare office, or similar public agency. To adopt a child through a public agency, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved, the agency will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the court gives the adoption order.
The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licensed by a provincial government. The process is very similar to going through the public agency. Note that there are no provincial caps on adoption fees, which can range from $6,000 to $25,000.

Family Law,Child support,117,"
				While courts in each province have the power to make orders for child support, if parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, usually the other parent is responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support.

Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

You can assume your spouse’s surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.
You can legally change your surname based on marital status. The right to change one’s surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.

You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.

Business Law,Extending credit and credit checks,229,"
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver’s Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

 1. Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can claim a security or lien on a debtor’s specific asset, usually the item you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor.
A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

Newfoundland Collections Act
NWT Consumer Protection Act
Nova Scotia Collection Agencies Act
Nunavut Consumer Protection Act
Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.
For the legislation regarding what collections agencies can and cannot do in your province or territory, visit Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of Consumer Affairs.
If you require legal help, contact a lawyer.

Having said that however, for practical purposes, any record held at a government office, containing information about a person’s criminal activity or involvement is considered to be a type of criminal record. This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

				What is considered trafficking?

“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.

Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.

What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.


Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.

If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.

Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation.

Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts’ willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go “forum shopping”. Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

			Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

Employment Law,What is wrongful dismissal?,606,"
				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay. Under the law, if your employer refuses to pay you what you are entitled to, then you have been wrongfully dismissed. However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you. If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.

				It is important to determine if you were wrongfully dismissed, because you may be entitled to money from your employer. If you were fired, you may be entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and severance pay.

However, if your employer gave you proper notice, or paid you all the money you were entitled to, it is not considered wrongful dismissal even if there was no cause for firing you. If the employer had a good legal reason, or cause, for firing you, then you are not entitled to notice or pay instead of notice, and you are not considered wrongfully dismissed.
 
What is ’cause’ for firing an employee?
An employee can be fired without proper notice if there was ’cause’, also known as ‘just cause”. Cause for firing an employee may include:

an illegal act at the workplace, such as stealing or damaging property, or violent behaviour;
misrepresentation of important qualifications, such as saying you have a degree that you have not earned;
insubordination, such as refusing to do work assigned to you;
sexually harassing other employees;
constantly being late for work; and
fraud.

 
What is not ’cause’ for firing an employee?
Sometimes an employee does something wrong, but this wrong does not constitute a good legal reason to be fired without notice or pay. Reasons for firing an employee that are not cause under the law include:

if an employee does something minor and corrects the mistake;
if an employee’s work is not up to standard and the employer does nothing to address the problem;
if your employer does not like you;
if your employer discriminates against you because of your sex, race, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, unless permitted by law.

Claims for wrongful dismissal can involve substantial amounts of money. If you think you were wrongfully dismissed you should consult a lawyer.
More information on termination of employment may also be found from your provincial or territorial Ministry of Labour.  In Quebec, visit the Standards Commission, equity, health and safety at work (CNESST).

If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days. Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;

Internet and Cyber Law,Cyberbullying,363,"

In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say.","

Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP’s Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),What is a structured settlement?,486,"
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For","
				Structured settlements are, in essence, guaranteed tax-free annuities. A structured settlement is a way of paying or settling a claim for damages in a lawsuit on a periodic basis over a specified period or for life. Instalment payments are usually stretched out over a period of at least five years.
As with any legally required or awarded compensation for a wrongful injury or death, the structured settlement payments are free of tax. However, if the recipient of the payments uses the money to create a gain, such as interest, investment growth or capital gain, that portion is taxable.
Structured settlements are increasingly popular among insurance companies, plaintiffs and defendants. For the recipient, the structured settlement is a guaranteed flow of tax-free and creditor-proof payments that can last for many years or life. For the insurance company or other individual creating the structured settlement, the cash requirement to buy the annuity may be lower than the damages awarded.
A structured settlement can be very flexible in design. Payments can be designed to increase at specific points in time, such as when surgery is needed or large medical payments are expected later in life. The payments can be indexed at a fixed interest rate or linked to the Consumer Price Index to offset inflation. They can also include a series of lump-sum payments.
About half of all significant cases in Canada are settled on the basis of at least part of the settlement being paid with a series of tax-free payments over a fixed term of years or the lifetime of the claimant.
 
How is a structured settlement created?
The unsuccessful party in a lawsuit (or his or her insurance company) purchases an annuity that exactly fulfills the required payments to the successful party. The annuity is non-commutable, non-assignable, and non-transferable. This means no one (including creditors) can change or stop the annuity under any circumstances.
The annuity payments are generally guaranteed for a specific period by the insurance industry, but the original defendant is ultimately responsible for every payment to the claimant. The “guarantee period” may be for the first few decades on a life annuity or for a fixed term.
The right to structure a settlement must be negotiated during the settlement process and must be part of the documented settlement agreement. Funds to purchase the annuity must pass from the defendant or his or her agent to the annuity company or its agent. You cannot receive settlement funds first, and then purchase a structured settlement annuity after the fact. The annuity must, in fact, be purchased by the defendant or insurance company. During the weeks leading up to settlement, a claimant should make sure his or her lawyer is preserving the right to structure any part of the settlement.
In theory, anyone with a life insurance licence can sell a structured settlement annuity. Without specialized experience, though, a structured settlement may be improperly executed, leaving the claimant with significant tax liability. Structured settlement brokers (of which there are about a dozen in Canada) are well known in the legal profession and insurance community. The structured settlement broker will usually prepare all the required documents and help calculate the appropriate structure.
For legal advice about structured settlements you should consult a lawyer.

If you need time off during pregnancy or to care for a child, you can collect maternity or parental benefits.
If you cannot work because of sickness, you can collect sickness benefits.
Compassionate care benefits are available for those who have to take time off work temporarily, to provide care or support to a family member who is seriously ill and who has a significant risk of death within six months.
Fishing benefits are available for those self-employed in fishing, who are temporarily not earning an income from fishing.
Parents of Critically Ill Children (PCIC) benefits are available to parents who take leave from work to provide care or support to their critically ill or injured child.

 
Employment Insurance special benefits for self-employed people
Self-employed individuals also have the option to access Employment Insurance special benefits, namely:

maternity,
parental,
sickness,
compassionate care, and
benefits for parents of critically ill children.

In order to qualify, a self-employed person must first register with the Canada Employment Insurance Commission. They must also meet several criteria, including: being a Canadian citizen or permanent resident; operating his or her own business, or own more than 40% of a corporation’s voting shares, and be ineligible for regular EI benefits. A self-employed individual must wait at least 12 months from registering before qualifying for special benefits.
Self-employed Quebec residents must apply for maternity, paternity, and parental benefits through the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. All other benefits are available through the federal EI program.

What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

The debtor may only need a friendly reminder of the money owed so you should always try to be on good terms with the people you do business with.

Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount is within the limits of your province. Or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort, and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor’s assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor’s assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means you can take possession of the asset, sell it and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to ensure your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business, contact your local government. For legal advice, consult a lawyer.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under your provincial corporations act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
Although a corporation may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all provincial tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, your provincial Ministry of Finance will deny the application for dissolution. Therefore, you first must obtain proof from the Ministry of Finance that your corporation is in compliance with the tax laws and does not have any outstanding taxes. Once this is obtained, you can then proceed and your ministry or department responsible for Consumer Affairs can dissolve the corporation. You will likely need to provide copies of your Articles of Incorporation and a fee.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.

These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rule","
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For more information, you can access your provincial employment legislation, or contact your local Ministry of Labour.

a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.
For more information, you can access your provincial employment legislation, or contact your local Ministry of Labour.
For legal advice about employment contract matters, consult a lawyer.

				While courts in each province have the power to make orders for child support, if parents have separated or divorced and their children live all, or most of the time with one parent, usually the other parent is responsible to pay child support to help provide for the children. The amount of child support will generally depend on how many children are being supported and the amount of money being earned by the parent paying the child support. Payments, from the parent who does not have custody to the parent who does, are usually made through a government office and sometimes directly from the one parent to the other.
In situations of joint, shared, or split custody, the responsibility for child support may be reduced depending on the extent of parenting assumed by each parent and by their respective incomes.
 
Child support agreements
If parents can agree, they may enter into their own child support agreement, which is often part of a separation agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement, they can ask a judge to determine the amount. Services such as mediation, or government family services may be able to help parents with this process. To ensure that you understand your legal rights and obligations, however, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer before signing a child support agreement.
 
Which children must be supported?
Child support is generally available for any child under the age of majority, which is 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory in which the child lives. In some circumstances, child support does not have to be paid for a child who is 16 or 17 if they have chosen to move out of the family home and no longer live by their parent’s rules. In contrast, child support can be required for children over the age of majority if they are unable to withdraw from parental support, such as children who are still in full-time attendance at school or unable to support themselves because of a disability.
Generally speaking, child support obligations will relate to the birth parents. However it is important to remember that anyone who treats the child of another as their own child may also assume a legal obligation of child support. A typical illustration would be where a man marries a woman who has two young children by a previous marriage. In the course of marriage the man may form a close bond with those children and come to be regarded as a “father” for the purposes of paying child support.
 
How is the amount of child support determined?
In Canada, the provinces and territories share responsibility with the federal government for matters relating to child support. The minimum amount of child support to be paid is based on federal and provincial government Guidelines. The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a table that is used to calculate child support payments, which are based on the income of the parent who pays support, and the number of children entitled to support.
Whether the provincial or the federal Guidelines apply, depend on a number of factors, such as if the parents are married. Specifically, depending on where you live,

The federal Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who are already divorced or are in the process of getting a divorce.
Provincial and territorial Child Support Guidelines apply to parents who were never married and who both live in Canada, or who are married to each other and are separated, or planning to separate, but have decided not to divorce.

The Federal Child Support Guidelines apply if you are getting divorced and:

you and the other parent both live in Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or the Yukon, or
you and the other parent live in different provinces, or
one parent lives outside of Canada.

However, under the same situation, if you and the other parent both live in New Brunswick, Manitoba or Quebec, provincial child support Guidelines apply.To find out which Guidelines apply to you, visit the federal Department of Justice.
While the income of the parent who pays support generally determines how much child support is paid, the rules determining income can be complex but are usually calculated on a spouse’s total annual income. There are also issues involving add-ons, such as day-care, and undue hardship that may have to be resolved. Both the judges deciding child support, and the parents who are setting up the agreement on their own, can use the applicable Guidelines when deciding how much support should be paid.
 
Support orders made before the federal 1997 Guidelines
Support orders made before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect are still valid, but either parent can ask the court to have the order changed so that the Guidelines will apply.
 
Tax treatment of child support payments
At one time, the person who paid child support could subtract it from his or her taxable income. The person who received the child support had to add it to his or her taxable income.
The Income Tax Act has been changed and child support that is paid according to a written agreement or a court order made on or after May 1, 1997, is neither deducted from the payer’s income nor added to the recipient’s income.
For people with agreements before May 1, 1997, these tax rules do not apply and are not retroactive. That said, the parents can agree to have the tax rules apply to their existing order if they don’t want to change the amount but simply want the new tax treatment. Also, if they get a new order or agreement changing the amount of child support, then the newer tax rules will apply.
 
When does child support end?
If you have a court order, or have entered into an agreement for child support, the conditions under which the support will end should be specified. For example, support might stop only when a child reaches a certain age or obtains a certain level of education. However, many support orders and agreements do not include a termination clause. Generally, in such cases, support must continue until both parents agree that it will end. If the parents cannot agree on a child support termination date, the matter can be brought to court.
For more information on the federal Guidelines for child support, visit the Department of Justice. For information on child support Guidelines where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are at least four advantages to owning a franchise.

You are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor.
For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice.
You enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor’s reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product.
It is sometimes easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.

Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
Most provinces have legislation that govern all types of franchise relationships, such as Ontario’s Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, and the New Brunswick Franchises Act. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Ontario, franchise sellers may be required to meet certain disclosure requirements and provide a full package of information on your rights and responsibilities. Visit the Canadian Franchise Association for information on legislation in your province.
There are many complicated legal issues involved in buying and operating franchises. Consult both a lawyer and an accountant when planning to enter into a franchise agreement.
For more information about franchises, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to","
				What is a separation agreement?
A separation agreement is a written agreement between two spouses who have separated or are about to separate. The agreement generally establishes the rights for each spouse, including who lives in the family home, how property will be divided, who will pay the family debts, who makes child and spousal support payments, who has custody of children, and what kinds of visiting rights the other parent will have.
Writing a separation agreement is voluntary and is not required under the law to establish a legal separation. With or without an agreement, a separation is legal as soon as two spouses are living separately and at least one spouse does not intend to move back in together. However, a separation agreement resolves most of the issues of separating and makes the separation easier. When possible, spouses who separate should try to reach an agreement and formalize it as a separation agreement as soon as possible. Although reaching an agreement shortly after spouses separate helps the spouses to get on with their lives, separation agreements can be made before or after a formal divorce.
Unlike the restrictions placed on “Marriage Contracts,” the parties to a separation agreement can agree on possession of the matrimonial home and, as well, agree on the custody of children and rights of access.
 
Requirements for a legally binding separation agreement
To create a legally binding separation agreement both spouses must be completely open and honest about their financial situations. This requires a detailed disclosure of their significant assets and liabilities. The agreement must be in writing and signed by each party in the presence of a witness. The agreement must be entered into voluntarily and not under any duress. Each party must understand the agreement. It is in the interest of both parties that each of them receives independent legal advice. Some aspects of the agreement may eventually be subjected to judicial review and in certain areas, particularly where the rights of children are involved, the terms of the agreement can be overridden.
While it is the policy of the courts to uphold separation agreements, practically speaking, it is a good idea that one-sided agreements be avoided. Unfair agreements may tend to create resentments that can lead to court proceedings to change the agreement. Unfair agreements also encourage litigation on marriage breakdown which is the very thing that they are supposed to avoid. Although a separation agreement becomes legally binding once it is signed, the parties can vary the terms by further agreement at any time.
 
Enforcing a separation agreement
By entering into a separation agreement, each spouse will have the same rights and obligations as if a court ordered the terms of the separation agreement. If you are concerned your spouse is not going to fulfill some of the obligations in the agreement, file it with your provincial government. This will help enforce any schedule of payments under it. Responsibility for enforcing registered agreements in most provinces comes under the Justice or Attorney General’s ministry or department.   You can also file an agreement with the family law court in your province. Most provinces have enforcement agencies.
For example, in British Columbia, it is called the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program. In New Brunswick, it is the Family Support Orders Service. In Nova Scotia it is the Maintenance Enforcement Program; and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it is the Support Enforcement Program.
 
Who can prepare a separation agreement?
Although it is possible for spouses to prepare their own separation agreement, most are prepared and negotiated by lawyers. The rights and obligations in separation agreements are very important so each spouse should be certain of his or her legal rights before signing. If you are not each represented by a different lawyer when an agreement is prepared, you should at least consult with your own lawyer before signing.
For more information about separation agreements, refer to your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Provincial Social Assistance and Disability Support Programs
If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.
For more information or to apply for benefits, contact your local government office.
 
Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"
				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.

The debtor may only need a friendly reminder of the money owed so you should always try to be on good terms with the people you do business with.

The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount is within the limits of your province. Or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort, and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor’s assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor’s assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means you can take possession of the asset, sell it and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to ensure your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business, contact your local government. For legal advice, consult a lawyer.

Municipal by-laws throughout the country, and some provincial legislation, such as Yukon’s Dog Act and Ontario’s Dog Owners’ Liability Act, make dog owners liable for any damage caused by bites to persons or other domestic animals. In British Columbia, section 49 of its Community Charter gives specific consideration to “special powers in relation to dangerous dogs”.
In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit owning a dog for a certain time.
Currently, only the province of Ontario and the City of Winnipeg have specifically banned “pit bulls” from being bred, imported or transferred.

Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

			When two people live together in a conjugal relationship and are not married, they may be considered to be living in a common-law relationship. If you are living in a common-law relationship, you will have a number of rights and obligations arising under family law, tax law, welfare and family benefits, and employee benefit plans. Different rules apply for each of these areas of law.

Business Law,Home businesses,235,"
				 
General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,

1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships: where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations: which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and employment insurance contributions from the employees’ paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer’s legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
 
Special considerations for home businesses

1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence. In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
 
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public’s perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person’s home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues that arise with a home business can be very complicated, you should consult a lawyer for assistance and advice.
For more information about operating a business, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

For example, a group of people may have all been injured by a defective product or may all have suffered injury and financial losses as a result of a major accident.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or ‘certified’ by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant’s costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

Real Estate Law,What are condominiums?,0413,"
				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.

Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.

What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.


Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.
Visit Canada’s Department of Justice for more information about criminal law and the justice system in Canada, or, view the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to see information regarding specific drug related offences.

Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.
Visit Canada’s Department of Justice for more information about criminal law and the justice system in Canada, or, view the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to see information regarding specific drug related offences.

Nova Scotia Collection Agencies Act
Nunavut Consumer Protection Act
Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.
For the legislation regarding what collections agencies can and cannot do in your province or territory, visit Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of Consumer Affairs.

Business Law,Extending credit and credit checks,229,"
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver’s Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

 1. Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can claim a security or lien on a debtor’s specific asset, usually the item you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor.
A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Defamation: Libel and slander,480,"

The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days. Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

Harassment is also a form of discrimination. Harassment means that the ‘harasser’ acts in an annoying or abusive manner that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the other person.
Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.
For more information, access your local human rights laws, or if your case is federal, the Canadian Human Rights Act. For information about filing a human rights complaint, contact your provincial or territorial Human Rights Commission, or the Canadian Human Rights Commission at www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca.

Harassment is also a form of discrimination. Harassment means that the ‘harasser’ acts in an annoying or abusive manner that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the other person.
Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.
For more information, access your local human rights laws, or if your case is federal, the Canadian Human Rights Act. For information about filing a human rights complaint, contact your provincial or territorial Human Rights Commission, or the Canadian Human Rights Commission at www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under your provincial corporations act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
Although a corporation may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all provincial tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, your provincial Ministry of Finance will deny the application for dissolution. Therefore, you first must obtain proof from the Ministry of Finance that your corporation is in compliance with the tax laws and does not have any outstanding taxes. Once this is obtained, you can then proceed and your ministry or department responsible for Consumer Affairs can dissolve the corporation. You will likely need to provide copies of your Articles of Incorporation and a fee.
To obtain more information or forms of dissolution, contact your provincial Corporate Registry or visit Canada Business Network. For information on dissolving a business incorporated under the federal Canada Business Corporations Act, visit Corporations Canada.

Having said that however, for practical purposes, any record held at a government office, containing information about a person’s criminal activity or involvement is considered to be a type of criminal record. This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.

Internet and Cyber Law,Defamation laws (cyber-libel) and the Internet,361,"

The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation.

Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts’ willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go “forum shopping”. Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

				The increase of communications through the Internet – websites, social networking, emails, text/instant messaging – has resulted in people engaging in fewer real interactions and more cyber relationships.
Although there seems to be a great amount of communication, experts have stated that the use of technology does not provide the connectedness that real communications do, and instead, increases the feeling of being alone. People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say.","

People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.

				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Professional malpractice,482,"
				Professional malpractice refers to the negligence or misdeeds of professionals in their work. Included in this category are doctors, dentists, chiropractors, optometrists, nurses, lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and so forth. In most cases, lawsuits against professionals for malpractice are difficult to prove and can be expensive.
Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect.

To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the stand","

Standard for professionals
The law does not require professionals to be perfect. If they made a mistake that could have been made by a reasonable practitioner in similar circumstances, then they will not be liable for the injury or loss. To be successful in a lawsuit against a professional, you must prove that he or she failed to provide the standard of service or care that other reasonable practitioners would provide in similar circumstances. For example, if you were not informed by your doctor of all risks associated with a procedure, or if your accountant did not follow accepted practises, you may have grounds for a malpractice lawsuit. The standard of care that must be met will vary with the type of care or service required and the type of professional providing it.
Obligations of professionals
All professionals have obligations to their patients or clients. For example, before administering any kind of medical treatment, medical practitioners have an obligation to advise the patient fully of associated risks, to discuss other options, and to fully explain the treatment. Lawyers have an obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. The obligations that each profession has are based on the law and written guidelines of its governing body.
As a patient or client, you are also required to fulfill certain obligations under the law, such as providing a full medical history to your doctor or telling the truth about the case to your lawyer. If your failure to fulfill your obligations contributed to your injury or loss, the court may not hold the professional responsible and will not compensate you. If you are successful in suing a professional, the court may award you compensation for out-of-pocket expenses, lost income, legal fees, and for pain and suffering, if any.
Filing a complaint
Regardless of whether you decide to pursue a lawsuit against a professional, you also have the option of filing a formal complaint with the organization that governs that profession.
For example, if your complaint is with a medical doctor, you may contact the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, PEI, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In Québec it is the Collège des médecins du Québec; in Yukon, the Yukon Medical Council; Health and Social Services in the Northwest Territories; and Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavut. Visit Health Law for links to the applicable medical organization where you live.
If your complaint is with a chartered accountant, you may contact the Institute of Chartered Accountants where you live. Visit Business Law for a link.
If you wish to find out more about the professional standard for a specific profession, contact the organization that governs them. Be aware, however, that a finding of malpractice or negligence by a governing body may not result in any money being awarded to you. The governing body will, in most cases, be more concerned with disciplining the professional.
If you have suffered an injury or loss and you need legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer as soon as possible, because strict limitation periods may apply.

				Franchises are a popular way for people to buy and run businesses.
What is a franchise?
A franchise is a contract or agreement where a franchisor gives a franchisee the right to start a business under a business system that already exists. Under the franchise agreement, the franchise business usually uses the name or trademark of an existing company and conducts the same type of business as the existing company. The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.

The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are at least four advantages to owning a franchise.

You are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor.
For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice.
You enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor’s reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product.
It is sometimes easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.

Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
Most provinces have legislation that govern all types of franchise relationships, such as Ontario’s Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, and the New Brunswick Franchises Act. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Ontario, franchise sellers may be required to meet certain disclosure requirements and provide a full package of information on your rights and responsibilities. Visit the Canadian Franchise Association for information on legislation in your province.
There are many complicated legal issues involved in buying and operating franchises. Consult both a lawyer and an accountant when planning to enter into a franchise agreement.
For more information about franchises, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Animals and the Law,Dog owner liability,460,"

It does not matter if the person was bitten due to the owner’s fault, negligence, or knowledge of the propensity of the dog to bite.

Municipal by-laws throughout the country, and some provincial legislation, such as Yukon’s Dog Act and Ontario’s Dog Owners’ Liability Act, make dog owners liable for any damage caused by bites to persons or other domestic animals. In British Columbia, section 49 of its Community Charter gives specific consideration to “special powers in relation to dangerous dogs”.
In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit owning a dog for a certain time.
Currently, only the province of Ontario and the City of Winnipeg have specifically banned “pit bulls” from being bred, imported or transferred.

General business considerations
The term home business generally refers to a business that is run by someone who is self-employed and who operates the business out of their home. There are several legal issues that you should consider if you want to start a home business. Many of these are general issues that are important for all businesses. These include:
1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

1.  Form of the business
First, you will have to decide what form of business to use. The three main forms of business are:

Sole Proprietorships: this applies if you alone own the business and you do not want to form a corporation,
Partnerships: where two or more people own the business, but they do not want to, or are precluded by law from forming a corporation; and
Corporations: which can be owned by one or more people, and which is considered in law to be a separate legal entity.

Each form has different legal requirements, and each has several advantages and disadvantages. More information about the three forms of business is available in other Business Law topics.
 
2.  Employment standards and deductions
If your business employs people, you will have to follow general employment standards. For example, you cannot pay your employees less than the legal minimum wage, you cannot fire an employee in a way that violates the laws concerning termination of employment, and you must obey occupational health and safety laws.
You will also have to make deductions, such as Canada Pension Plan contributions and employment insurance contributions from the employees’ paycheques, and forward them to the federal government.
You can obtain more information about an employer’s legal responsibilities from both the Business Law and Employment Law sections of this website.
 
3.  Licences
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also need a federal, provincial or municipal licence. There are various government licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you plan to operate. A business lawyer can help you determine if any requirements apply in your circumstances.
 
Special considerations for home businesses

1.  Zoning restrictions
One of the main considerations when running a business out of your home is whether you are permitted to do so under your municipal zoning by-laws. Zoning restrictions are particularly important for home business owners because many activities are not allowed in residential areas. Generally, if you are working alone in a home office, there will not be any zoning issues. However, if you are manufacturing a product, for example, and require employees to work out of your home, and/or you are causing pollution, excessive waste or noise, you may have a zoning issue.
2.  Tax issues
There are also several additional tax issues that home business owners must consider. For example, working at home means that you may be able to deduct some of your housing costs from your income, which will reduce the amount of personal or business income tax you will have to pay. However, it also means that if you own your home, when you sell it, part of the value will not be considered your principal residence. In general, if a principal residence is sold, the owner does not have to pay capital gains on the increased value. However, if you have been deducting a portion of the home space as a business expense, it means that you will have to pay tax on capital gains allocated to the office portion of your home. One thing that you should do to minimize the negative tax implications of working at home is to get a letter of opinion about the value of your house from a realtor when you start the business.
Depending on the type of business you operate, you may also have a legal responsibility to collect various provincial and federal taxes. Visit Canada Revenue Agency for more information about the tax implications for home businesses. For assistance with your tax issues, you should contact an accountant.
 
3.  Public perception of home business
Another challenge for home businesses is the general perception of a home business. Sometimes, home businesses are not taken seriously or treated as favourably as businesses which operate out of a commercial or manufacturing facility. It can be more difficult for home businesses to secure a loan and to get sales.
However, the public’s perception is changing because the number of home businesses continues to increase rapidly. Also, if your business is based on services you personally provide, such as website development or graphic design work, it has become generally accepted that many of these types of services are performed from the person’s home. Further, given the global nature of our economy, many people do business over the internet and the location of the business is not relevant, so long as the goods and/or services exchanged meet the standards expected.
You can contact your local municipal authorities to determine if your home business will be affected by local zoning or other business regulations, or licensing requirements.
Starting a home business can be a risky and rewarding venture. Because the legal issues that arise with a home business can be very complicated, you should consult a lawyer for assistance and advice.
For more information about operating a business, contact your local government, or visit the Government of Canada, Canada Business Network.

Family Law,Adopting a child,125,"
				Provincial governments have many rules and guidelines for the adoption of children. These procedures must be followed to legally adopt a child.
 
Who can adopt a child?
To adopt a child, you usually must live in the same province as the child and you must usually be at least 18 or 19 years old, depending on your province’s age of majority. You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.

You do not have to be married but, if you are, your spouse must also agree in writing that he or she wants to adopt a child. Two people can only adopt a child together if they are married or living in a common-law relationship.
Any child under the age of majority can be adopted by married or unmarried adults, step-parents, or any other person (including a single individual) a court believes will honour the best interests of the child. All provinces allow same-sex adoptions. If an adult (someone who has attained the age of majority) is to be adopted, there may be restrictions on who can adopt (usually, only the person or couple who tended to the individual when he or she was a minor).
 
Giving permission for your child to be adopted
An adoption can generally take place only with the written permission of the natural parents. In most jurisdictions, consent for the adoption will be required from a child over the age of 12. In Quebec, consent is required from a child 10 years old and older.  In some circumstances, written permission may also be required from someone else who is providing financial support to the child or who has custody of or access to the child.
Depending on the province, the child must be a certain number of days old before written permission for adoption can be given, such as seven days in Ontario and Newfoundland. In British Columbia, consent cannot be given until the baby is 10 days old. Again, depending on the province, there is also a time period in which the natural parents can change their minds and cancel the permission. For instance, in British Columbia and Quebec, a birth mother can withdraw her consent within 30 days of the child’s birth, while in Ontario, the mother has 21 days. If permission is cancelled within the prescribed period, the child must be returned to the natural parents. If the period has gone by and the child has been placed with an adoptive family, the natural parents cannot normally change their minds about the adoption.
In some situations, the court can decide that written consent of the natural parents is not needed. For instance, if the identity of the natural father is unknown, or if he has disappeared, or if a child has been neglected or abused, the court can allow the child to be adopted without the parents’ consent.
How to adopt a child
There are generally two common ways to adopt a child, depending on the province: public adoption and private adoption. Public adoption is through a local Children’s Aid Society, provincial Child Welfare office, or similar public agency. To adopt a child through a public agency, you must first apply and go through a standard screening process. If your application is approved, the agency will try to match you with a suitable child. A social worker will visit with you and the child and help you apply to the court to make the adoption final. Usually the child has to have been in your care for six months before the court gives the adoption order.
The second way to adopt a child is through a private agency licensed by a provincial government. The process is very similar to going through the public agency. Note that there are no provincial caps on adoption fees, which can range from $6,000 to $25,000.
Regardless of what province or territory they live in, generally, every potential adoptive parent must complete a homestudy, sometimes called a family assessment, conducted by a social worker through visits to the home, to make sure the adoption is suitable for the parents and the child. In most cases, the home study includes an educational component to help prepare all prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising an adopted child.
Adopting a member of your own family
If you want to adopt a member of your own family, such as a grandchild or step-child, in most cases, you do not need to go through a public or private adoption agency, but you still need to go to court to get a formal adoption order.
International adoptions
For personal or humanitarian reasons, many people choose to adopt a child from abroad.
For all international adoptions, two separate processes must be followed: 1) the adoption process, and 2) the immigration or citizenship process. In Canada, while the same immigration and citizenship processes apply to all provinces and territories, the rules for adoption differ in each region. For more information, refer to the Family Law topic #127 – Adopting a child from abroad.
Adopting a child is a very important and complicated process. For more information on the adoption process and laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.
Spouses in all provinces, except Quebec, have the option of assuming their spouses’ name without changing their birth certificates. To do this, you can automatically assume your married name and use your marriage certificate as proof of marriage, and change of name, when applying to update your business and government records. Your birth certificate will not change, which means that after a divorce, you may use it as proof if you re-assume your original name. Some places may also require proof of divorce to change their records.
 
Legally changing your name upon marriage
Both men and women can apply to have their last names legally changed after marriage, by changing the names on their birth certificates and having the government issue a change of name certificate. To do this, you need to complete a change of name application form. There is usually a fee to legally change your name after a marriage or a divorce.
It is the responsibility of the individual who is changing their name to make arrangements to change their name on other documents and records, such as a driver’s licence, passport, and credit cards.
 
Can you change your name upon marriage in Quebec?
In Quebec, both spouses keep their birth names after marriage and continue to exercise their civil rights under that name, meaning they must use their birth name in contracts, on credit cards, on their driver’s licence, and so on. This rule applies even if they were married outside Quebec. However, women married before April 2, 1981 who were already using their husband’s surname before that date may continue to exercise their civil rights under their married name.
 
Formal name change for reasons other than marriage
The requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. In most provinces, the person must be 18 years old to change their name. In New Brunswick and British Columbia you must be 19 years old, and in Ontario you must be at least 16 years old to change your name. A formal name change will require that the person complete a government application form, provide documentary evidence such as a birth certificate, former name change certificates, and court orders or police records check.
Once the name change is complete, the individual will receive notification in writing. This type of name change will change the person’s name on their birth certificate.
 
Changing a child’s name
The completion of a consent form is usually required for a child’s change of name.  The child’s consent is required if the child is, in most cases, 12 years of age or older.
To find out the rules and steps to change your name, visit your provincial government Vital Statistics office.
				Was your question answered?
			Many people change their name when they get married, as well as for other personal or professional reasons. Each province and territory has different procedures involving changing a person’s name, depending on their age and the circumstances under which they want it changed.
Generally, there are four ways to change your name:

You can assume your spouse’s surname (last name) upon marriage without completing a formal name change application.
You can legally change your surname based on marital status. The right to change one’s surname based on marital status applies to both men and women.
You can legally change your entire name for any other reason.
You can apply to change your child’s name.

Depending on why and when you change your name there may be a fee.
 
Changing your name upon marriage or divorce
In Canada, the law does not require a person to change their last name when they get married. In most cases, both spouses have the right to use: their own last name; their spouse’s last name; a combination of both last names, hyphenated or not, in any order they choose; and their spouse’s last name, with their own last name as a given or middle name.  In some provinces, there may be a limit on the number of hyphenated surnames. Also, you can change your name back to its original when you get divorced without applying for a legal name change.

Types of charities
In Canada, there are four “heads” or categories of charities:

Relief of poverty
Advancement of education
Advancement of religion
Other purposes beneficial to the community

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.

In Canada, there are four “heads” or categories of charities:

Relief of poverty

Advancement of religion
Other purposes beneficial to the community

It is not enough for the purpose or activity of an organization to be praiseworthy and worthwhile in and of itself. In order for an organization to be considered charitable, it must be operated for the benefit of the community or a significantly important class of the community. The basic theory for allowing charitable and not-for-profit organizations preferential tax treatment is that they are not meant to make profits but rather are established to provide benefits for the public.
A Canadian charitable organization may be incorporated or unincorporated. There are three types of Canadian charities:

Charitable organizations,
Public foundations, and
Private foundations.

Each of these must meet different requirements.
In order for a not-for-profit organization to obtain charitable status, it must file an application with and receive the approval of Canada Revenue Agency, Charities Division. If the organization wishes to become incorporated, it must also file an application for incorporation either federally or provincially.
 
Advantages of charitable registration
The advantages of charitable status are primarily tax-based. These include exemption from, and reduced liability for, certain municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the ability to issue income tax credit receipts for donations.
In addition, charitable status generally provides an organization with a positive image from the public’s perspective.
 
Registration
To apply for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada), various documents must be filed with Canada Revenue Agency. If all the documentation and information filed is acceptable to Canada Revenue Agency, the organization will receive written notice of its registration as a charity within approximately eight to 12 months, subject to the discretion of Canada Revenue Agency.
Considering the privileges that charities enjoy in our society, an organization must satisfy a number of conditions before it can be registered and it must continue to meet various obligations to maintain its charitable status. Charities must file an annual information return with Canada Revenue Agency. In addition, charities must disburse their funds for charitable purposes in accordance with a specified quota.
All not-for-profit corporations, whether charitable or non-charitable, must have audited financial statements and must be carried on without the purpose of gain for their members.
For more information, visit Canada Revenue Agency. Visit Canada Business Network for information on registering as a charity.
If you require legal advice or assistance with regard to a not-for-profit or charitable organization, you should consult a lawyer.

Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent.

				What is CASL?
Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada’s Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, visit CBSA.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Regional Business Service Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.

Business Law,Contracts,242,"
				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.

				In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.


Breach of Contract
Breach of contract occurs when one (or more) of the parties breaks a promise made under the agreement. The breach can be in relation to a minor promise, or go to the heart of the agreement. A breach can also occur where one of the parties does something different from what was expected, or only partially fulfills an obligation under the agreement.
 
Remedies for Breach of Contract
If a contract is broken, the injured party can allow the breach (if it is minor) and continue with the agreement, or stop performing their part of the contract and ask for compensation for the breach. The types of remedies available for breach of contract are:

Monetary damages. The injured party may be entitled to compensation for a loss, to put them in the place they would have been in had the contract been completed, or punitive damages (to punish the party that breached the contract),
Injunction, where a court orders the party that committed the breach to stop doing something, or
Specific performance, where the court orders the party that committed the breach to do something.


How are contracts affected by legislation?
The content and parameters of contracts are often restricted by provincial and federal statutes. For example, consumer contracts are subject to various rules set out in provincial consumer protection and sale of goods legislation. In an attempt to protect consumers, these laws set out several rules, such as what must be included in the contract, what would be considered a false or misleading representation, and how agreements can be cancelled if the seller does not live-up-to the requirements set out in the legislation.
In employment situations, provincial employment standards laws apply. The provisions of these Acts contain requirements, for example, with regard to wages, and maximum limits with regard to hours of work. The employment agreement cannot contract out of these provisions so that the employee is adversely affected.
Before entering into an agreement, it is important that you understand what obligations you are agreeing to undertake. If you need legal advice, you should consult a lawyer.
				Was your question answered?
			In Canada, the law of contracts is based on English common law, except for Quebec, where the civil law applies. Generally, Canadians have the freedom to enter into contracts whenever they want and for whatever reason they choose. There are some limits, however, based on restrictions found in legislation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more persons, which creates one or more legal obligations between them, to do, or not to do, something. The term persons can include individuals, organizations, corporations and other types of legal entities.
For a contract to be legally binding, it must include the following elements:

Legality,
Mutual agreement,
Consideration, and
Capacity.

Legality: For a contract to be legally binding, that is, enforceable at law, it must not create obligations to do something that is illegal. For example, an agreement to steal something cannot form the basis for a legal contract.
Mutual agreement: Mutual agreement is arrived at when one of the parties makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. Commonly referred to as ‘offer and acceptance’. Both the offer and the acceptance must be clear and unequivocal. In addition, the offer can be revoked (cancelled) before it is accepted, unless the offer specifically states that it will remain open for a specific time-period, and it has expired.
Consideration: Consideration can be a monetary payment or can also be a promise.
Capacity: In order to ensure that the parties to the contract can be held accountable under the agreement, the parties must be of sound mind. A contract made by someone who is determined to be mentally incapable of entering into the agreement, generally, will not be obligated under the agreement. Mental incapacity can arise for different reasons, such as due to a disability or if the person was intoxicated.
In addition, it is advisable that both parties have reached the age of majority. If one of the parties is a minor, the contract will not be enforceable against the minor. However, if the other party is an adult, they will be obligated to the minor under the agreement.
Capacity can also relate to legal entities that are not people, such as corporations. For example, if the person who signed on behalf of the corporation did not have the authority to do so, the contract might not be enforceable.
 
Oral and written agreements
A contract can be either oral (spoken), or written, provided that the elements required to form a legally binding contract have been met. In some cases, however, the law requires the contract to be in writing, such as transactions for the purchase and sale of real property (land).
Wherever possible, it is advisable that important agreements be made in writing. In a written agreement the parties have the advantage of being able to clearly explain the terms and promises, such as the services or goods to be provided, the performance schedule and payment amounts. By having the components of the agreement written out, it makes it easier for both parties to understand and fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
 
When can a contract be cancelled?
If a contract is not enforceable, under the law, it can be set aside. To set aside a contract means to cancel or rescind the agreement. The legal reasons to cancel a contract are:

Misrepresentation – a false statement of fact made by one of the parties to the other for the purpose of inducing them to enter into the agreement. If the misrepresentation is of a material (important) fact, it makes the contract voidable.
Mistake – where one (or more) of the parties had an incorrect understanding of what the contract was concerning.
Duress and undue influence – when one party compels or threatens the other to enter into the agreement against their will. The injured party needs to prove that there was a threat and that that was the reason they made the contract.
Incapacity – those entering into an agreement must have the legal capacity with regard to age, mental capacity and authority.
Illegal contracts. A contract can be illegal if it violates a law. Although this can include criminal laws, it can also relate to a contract made against other provincial, territorial or federal laws.

Legal representation is always required when bringing a class action, and the class of plaintiffs must be approved or ‘certified’ by the court.
If you are the first or main person starting the lawsuit, you are called the representative plaintiff. Being the representative plaintiff means that you could personally be responsible for paying the defendant’s costs if you lose the lawsuit and you do not get any financial support from the other plaintiffs.
If you are not the first or main plaintiff but are notified that you are part of a class proceeding, you have the choice of either remaining in the class or opting out. By opting out, you will not be involved in the court proceeding and you will not be entitled to share in any money awarded to other members of the class.
Starting or joining a class action can have large cost consequences and is usually difficult emotionally. Before bringing or joining a class action, you should consult a lawyer for advice and detailed information about the process.

This is so because many different types of criminal information can be collected, stored and used against an individual. In essence, if anything is on file, a police clearance cannot be obtained. For example, if a person was a suspect in a criminal investigation his or her name and date of birth will be on file with the police. This type of file is called an incident report. Although no charges were laid, a police records search will show that the individual was a suspect in a criminal investigation.
If you have ever been fingerprinted in relation to a criminal offence, you have a criminal record which will appear on police record searches. Even if you were found not guilty or if the charges were withdrawn, stayed or dismissed there is a police record of your arrest, a court record of your trial, and an RCMP record.
Once a criminal record exists, it is up to the individual to complete the proper paperwork to have the record removed.

				The word “condominium” refers to a specific kind of legal ownership, and can include:

high-rise or low-rise apartment style buildings,
townhouses,
lofts, and
detached or semi-detached houses.

Each owner of a condominium unit owns legal title to his or her own unit, and all owners together own, and share the expenses of maintaining, a number of facilities in the building called “common elements.” Common elements usually include things such as gardens, parking areas, hallways, elevators, and recreational facilities.
 
Declaration, description, and the condominium corporation
New condominiums are created legally when two documents are registered — the description and declaration. The description includes building plans and a property survey. The declaration is the equivalent of a constitution or charter for the condominium corporation, and may include restrictions that apply to condominium residents. For example, the declaration may include a prohibition against keeping pets.
In addition to these two documents, condominiums also have by-laws and rules dealing with matters such as duties and powers of the condominium board of directors, and the rights and obligations of any residents (such as tenants) and owners of the condominium.
Each condominium development becomes a condominium corporation once the declaration and description are registered. All condominium owners are owners in the corporation and given rights to vote on certain matters. The directors of the corporation, who are elected by the owners, handle the day-to-day running of the condominium or delegate it to a management company.
 
Common elements and monthly condominium fees
In most condominium corporations, each owner is responsible for the maintenance and repair of his or her own unit and the corporation is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements.
To pay for the general maintenance and upkeep of the common element facilities, condominium owners pay monthly common expenses (also known as “maintenance fees”). The amount of each resident’s common expenses will usually depend on the size of the unit and facilities offered. Condominiums with swimming pools and entertainment centres, for example, will generally have higher monthly common expenses than buildings without these facilities. Monthly fees can be significant, so it is important to keep this in mind before purchasing a condominium unit.
 
Status certificate
Buyers of resale condominiums should take extra care to investigate the financial situation of the condominium corporation before finalizing a purchase agreement. It is advisable that you and your lawyer examine the status certificate, also called an estoppel certificate in some provinces (in BC it is called an information certificate), and review the financial statements and the current budget. A status certificate contains basic and essential information concerning both the financial status of a particular unit and that of the condo corporation. In addition, it contains the condo declaration, by-laws, budget, reserve fund, insurance, management contract, rules, minutes of the last annual general meeting, and mention of any lawsuit involving the corporation.
Pay particular attention to the amount of money held in the reserve fund of the condominium corporation. Ensure there are sufficient funds to cover ongoing maintenance and repair of the condominium’s major capital items, such as expected roof or parking garage repairs. A condominium purchaser’s Agreement of Purchase and Sale should be conditional on the purchaser receiving this package, having a set number of days to review it, and being satisfied with its contents.
Purchasing a condominium involves many legal and financial documents. It is a good idea to have your lawyer assist you to ensure that you understand all the documents and obligations that apply to the condo and your unit.

Family law issues
If you are considered to be living in a common-law relationship under family law, you may have an obligation to financially support your spouse if you separate. There are two ways for a common-law relationship to arise under family law.
First, a common-law relationship can legally arise when two people have been living together in a conjugal relationship for a specific period of time. Second, a common-law relationship can also legally arise when two people have been living together in an ongoing relationship for any period and they have a child together.
For example, to be considered common-law under provincial family law, a couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship:

in New Brunswick, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in PEI,  for three continuous years; or have a child,
in Ontario, for three continuous years, or have a child and a have been living together in a relationship of some permanence;
in Manitoba, for three continuous years, or one year and have a child;
in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, for two continuous years; and
in British Columbia, for at least two continuous years, or for less than two continuous years if they have a child together.

In Alberta, common-law spouses are referred to as “adult interdependent partners” and are considered common-law when the couple has lived together for three years or more or has a child and live together.
Quebec is the only province that does not recognize common-law relationships.
Sometimes it may not be clear if two people have been living common-law. The law tries to decide whether two people have been living in a common-law relationship by looking at whether they cohabit. Incidents of cohabitation will include whether the couple lives together, whether one person was financially supporting the other, whether they have had a sexual relationship, and whether they shared household expenses and child raising duties.
 
Tax law issues
Under tax law, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people have been living in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or when two people have a child together. If you are considered to be a common-law spouse under tax law, you will have certain rights and obligations when you are filling out your yearly income tax return. For example, you may be able to claim a dependent spouse credit if you are financially supporting your common law spouse.
Welfare or social assistance and family benefits issues
If you are considered to be a common-law spouse for welfare and family benefits, you must include your common-law spouse’s income on your application for benefits. Under the welfare and family benefits rules, a common-law relationship legally arises when two people live together as a couple for any period, however short, and share financial responsibilities. Someone could become your common-law spouse on the day they move in with you under these rules.
Employee benefit plan issues
Finally, if you are considered to be a common-law spouse under your spouse’s employee benefit plan, you may be entitled to benefits such as prescription medication, life insurance and dental coverage. Employers can make their own rules for when a common-law relationship arises. Some employment benefit plans let common-law spouses share in the benefit plan if they have been living together for just six months. Others may require that spouses have lived together for one, three or five years.
Depending on the province where you live, the rules of a common-law relationship may be applied to same-sex relationships. An employment benefit plan that denies coverage to same-sex couples may be considered discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore unconstitutional under provincial human rights legislation.
If you need additional information about how living with someone can affect your legal rights, a lawyer can give you advice based on your individual situation.

Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.
 
What a collection agency cannot do
Although the regulations differ slightly across Canada, there are a number of common restrictions on what collection agencies cannot do.  They include:

Recommending or starting legal or court action to collect a debt without first notifying you.
Using profane, intimidating or coercive language, or threaten you in any way, whether by mail, email, text, over the phone, or in person.
Calling to collect a debt at certain prohibited times (which vary from one province or territory to another).
Implying or giving false or misleading information to anyone.
Communicating or attempting to communicate with you without identifying themselves, saying who is owed the money and stating the amount owed.
Continuing to demand payment from a person who claims not to owe the money, unless the agency first takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the person does, in fact, owe the money.
Contacting your friends, employer, relatives or neighbours for information, other than to get your telephone number or address.

If you need help dealing with a collection agency or if you think the collection agency is breaking the law, contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office. You may also be entitled to bring an action against them in Small Claims Court.
For the legislation regarding what collections agencies can and cannot do in your province or territory, visit Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of Consumer Affairs.
If you require legal help, contact a lawyer.
 
				Was your question answered?
			Collection agencies are either hired by creditors to collect debts on their behalf or these agencies purchase debts at a discount and keep the entire amount if they are able to collect it.
Collection agencies in Canada are governed by provincial and territorial laws. The rules are either set out their consumer protection legislation, or sometimes in laws specific to collection agencies. These include the:

Alberta Fair Trading Act
BC Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act
Manitoba Consumer Protection Act
New Brunswick Collection Agencies Act 
Newfoundland Collections Act
NWT Consumer Protection Act
Nova Scotia Collection Agencies Act
Nunavut Consumer Protection Act
Ontario Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act
PEI Collection Agencies Act
Saskatchewan Collection Agents Act
Yukon Consumer Protection Act

Some provinces also have Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulations.
If a collection agency phones you, this probably means you have more severe financial difficulties than you think. You should consider credit counselling or at least work out your budget and consider what realistic payments you can make. You can try to negotiate a payment schedule or payment of a reduced lump sum amount. The collection agency should stop calling if you are able to reach an agreement.
 
What a collection agency can do
Although collection agencies can be very persistent, the law places limits on their behaviour. There are procedures a collection agency must follow. In most provinces and territories you must be notified in writing that an account has been turned over to a collection agency.  Agencies are required to do this or to make a reasonable attempt to do so. Generally, this notice must include: the name of the creditor (the person or business that says you owe them money); the amount the creditor says you owe; and, the name of the collection agency and proof of its authority to demand payment on behalf of the creditor.

Business Law,Extending credit and credit checks,229,"
				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,

				Many businesses extend credit to their customers. This means the business provides goods or services to the customer without requiring payment right away. The customer then owes the business a debt.
Before you extend credit to your customers, you can conduct a number of searches to check the credit record of the borrower and verify whether other lenders have existing claims on their assets. The type of credit search you will need depends on the type of business you are in and the amount of credit you want to offer. The eight most common searches include:

A search under the provincial or territorial Personal Property Security Act,
A credit search at a Credit Bureau,
An execution search,
A search under the federal Bank Act,
A corporate search,
A bankruptcy search,
A search at the Official Receiver’s Office, and
A Vehicle Record and Driver Record search.

 1. Personal Property Security Act search
In exchange for extending credit to your customers, you can claim a security or lien on a debtor’s specific asset, usually the item you sold to them. This means that if the customer does not pay the debt, you can take possession of their asset, sell it, and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any money received from the sale that is more than the amount owed must be returned to the debtor.
A Personal Property Security Act search is conducted to determine if there are any registered liens against the personal property of the individual or the business. This is important because the customer may have already used the property as collateral.To conduct this search, visit your local land Registry Office or the provincial Personal Property Security office. Searches in most provinces are inexpensive.
2. Credit Bureau search
The second type of search is a credit search. A credit search provides information about the credit history and credit rating of the person or business you are searching. It will also give you some information about outstanding loan or credit card payments, if the borrower makes payments on time, and if there are outstanding liens. It will also help you to determine the level of risk involved in giving credit to the customer.
To conduct this search, information will have to be obtained from the two credit bureaus: Equifax, and TransUnion Canada. Credit information can only be obtained by businesses who are registered members of the credit bureau. Businesses wishing to be members must pay an annual membership fee. It is not possible for individuals to be registered, however, individuals can request their own personal credit check. Therefore, a business can require the borrower to obtain and submit their credit report before being extended credit by the business.
3. Writ of Execution search
The third type of search is an execution search. An execution search reveals whether there is a legal judgment against the person or business being searched. A judgment is a decision made by a court, and means that the court has ordered that person or business to pay a sum of money. The person who is owed money by your customer may have legal claims to their property. Also, if your customer already has a judgment against them, it probably means that they are a credit risk.
To conduct an execution search, you commonly visit the local sheriff ‘s office or other similar official in the area where the person being searched lives, works, or owns property. You will be required to fill out a search form and pay a small fee. Searches may also be available through Provincial government Justice or Attorney General offices.  As well, there are commercial services that conduct these searches for a small fee.
4. Bank Act search
A fourth type of search is a Bank Act search. A Bank Act search will reveal whether a bank has taken security on the same property that your customer is trying to give you as collateral. If the bank does have a claim on the property, it means that it has loaned your customer money and that it has the right to take possession of and sell the property if the loan is not paid. This is important for you to know for two reasons. First, it shows that the person or business you are going to lend money to already has a debt with the bank and it therefore may not be in a stable financial position. Second, it will show you if the collateral you are supposed to receive is already secured.
A private search firm can conduct this search for you for a small fee.
5. Corporate search
A fifth type of search is a corporate search. A corporate search reveals information about a corporation including the registered corporate name, any registered business names, the date of incorporation, whether the corporation is active, and the names of the directors and officers.
This search can be done through the government ministry responsible for businesses in your province. If you wish to search a Canadian corporation, you can search online at Corporations Canada.
6. Bankruptcy search
The sixth type of search is a bankruptcy search which tells you whether the person or company being searched has filed for bankruptcy in the last five to six years. This search can be done by contacting the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. There is a small fee for each name searched.
7. Search at the Official Receiver’s office
A search at the Official Receiver’s office reveals whether the person or company being searched is or has been bankrupt. It also reveals whether it has filed a proposal under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. You can pay a private search company to conduct this search for you, for a small fee.
8. Vehicle Record and Driver Record search
Vehicle Record and Driver Record searches reveal information about vehicles and drivers, such as who owns a vehicle and how many vehicles the person being searched owns. To request these searches, complete specific forms that are available at the provincial transportation ministry.
For legal advice and assistance, you should consult a lawyer.

Business Law,Collecting debts,230,"
				Sometimes a business is owed money either by an individual or by another business. The person or business that owes you money is called a debtor and you are called the creditor. If you have trouble getting the money you are owed, there are several steps you should follow.
Contact the debtor
First, always telephone or contact the debtor in person. The debtor may only need a friendly reminder of the money owed so you should always try to be on good terms with the people you do business with. If a phone call does not work, you can send the debtor a letter detailing what is owed. The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering","

The letter serves as a formal notice of the debt and it may be required before you try other means of recovering your money.
Other options
If a phone call and a letter do not work, you have several options. You can hire a lawyer to try to collect the money on your behalf or you can take the debtor to Small Claims Court if the amount is within the limits of your province. Or, you can call a collection agency to take over recovery of the debt. If the collection agency recovers some or all the debt from the debtor, the agency will take a percentage of the money recovered as its fee. Finally, you can consider writing off the debt. Sometimes the amount of the debt is not worth the time, effort, and expense involved in collecting it.
If you have a security interest in the debtor’s assets
If you have loaned money and have taken the debtor’s assets as security, for example their car or equipment, you may be able to seize and sell the assets. This means you can take possession of the asset, sell it and take the money you are owed out of the proceeds. Any extra money from the sale of the asset must be returned to the debtor.
Debt collection is an important business matter. You should have a debt collection procedure in place to ensure your business does not experience cash flow problems.
For more information about debt collection while operating a business, contact your local government. For legal advice, consult a lawyer.

Lawsuits and Personal Injury (Litigation),Defamation: Libel and slander,480,"
				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements.

				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation. However, you may have to prove actual financial loss if you are suing for slander. There are some limited circumstances when you do not have to prove financial loss in slander cases, including when the slanderous statement damaged your professional or business reputation.
Notice and limitation periods
In Ontario, if you are suing a newspaper, radio or television station, you must usually give them notice of your intention to sue within six weeks of learning of the incident, and start your lawsuit within three months. In Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, notice periods are much shorter. If you are suing a newspaper or radio or television station, only 14 days notice must be given of your intent to sue, and in the case of a daily newspaper, the notice period is seven days. Further, the lawsuit must be started with three months. In Prince Edward Island, the notice period to sue a daily newspaper is only five days. In Quebec, as with most matters, the laws regarding defamation are unique to the rest of Canada, and are set out in its Civil Code as opposed to specific defamation legislation.
If you are suing someone other than a newspaper, radio or television station, you must normally start your lawsuit within two years. If you are defending such a claim, publishing an apology may help to limit the amount of damages that may be awarded.

Defences
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel or slander, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

The requirements of proving a libel or slander case are technical. For more information on pursuing a lawsuit for libel or slander, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines.

Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program

People then lose much of their ability to have empathy and deep understanding, and can often end-up making thoughtless, quick statements. In addition, experiences and emotions are often exaggerated or faked in order for the person to have something interesting to say. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in cyberbullying. The Government of Canada reports that 8% of Canadian online teens say they have been victims of cyberbullying on social networking sites.
Cyber communication has created, among other things, the ability for:

information to be communicated quickly,
information to be spread widely,
the communicator to be distanced from the recipients of the communication, and
statements to remain available and accessible forever.

Most cyberbullying occurs with teenagers, however, it can start with children at a much younger age. As well, even adults have engaged in similar behaviour in workplace communications – for example, through emails, or online corporate bulletin boards.
 
What is cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying occurs when someone becomes a target of actions by others – using computers, cellphones or other devices – that are intended to embarrass, humiliate, torment, threaten or harass. It can happen only once, or occur repeatedly.
Teens sometimes refer to cyberbullying as hating, trolling, or drama. Some common forms of cyberbullying include using the Internet, specifically social websites, text/instant messaging, and emails resulting in:

Libel or Insult – posting or spreading untrue and harmful information about a person. For example, spreading false rumours or gossip, which is intended to embarrass the other person.
Targeting and Inciting Hate – singling out a person (or group of people) and inciting others to attack or hate them. For example, creating online polls designed to rate someone within negative categories; or creating online hate groups.
Identity Theft – pretending to be someone else for the purpose of doing harm, such as sending hurtful, offensive, or embarrassing messages or posts as though you were them. For example, impersonating someone else by hacking someone’s email account, or using their telephone, or using someone’s password to get into their social networking account.
Uploading – sharing images of a person, particularly in an embarrassing situation, without her or his permission, or sharing emails without the writer’s permission. For example, take embarrassing pictures or video of someone and then sending it to others or posting it without their knowledge or permission.
Excluding – encouraging or pressuring others to exclude someone from, either an online or offline, community or group.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Sextortion)– sending mean, insulting or threatening messages repeatedly, such as posting or sending stories, pictures, jokes, or cartoons that are intended to embarrass or humiliate; threatening the victim with harm if they do not post intimate sexual photos and videos of themselves.

 
How can you prevent cyberbullying?
 
Children, teens and cyberbullying
There are a number of ways a parent can help protect their children from cyberbullying. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open and talk with your children about cyberbullying. Find out if anyone they know, including themselves, has been a victim, a witness, or a perpetrator of cyberbullying. It will require discussions about what forms cyberbullying can take, and the harmful and long lasting effects it creates.
Parents can take necessary steps to:

Learn what your child is doing online, for example, what websites they visit and what online accounts they may have,
Teach your child safe online behaviour, such as the consequences of posting something online,
Set rules for your child’s online activity, including using privacy settings; make sure they are aware of the importance of safe passwords,
Keep abreast of the newest social media messaging and the latest telephone applications being used by children,
Teach your child how to respond to cyberbullying, including not responding to, and blocking the person doing the bullying,
Compare in-person communications and online communications, explain that what is not acceptable in-person, is also not acceptable online,
Openly discuss that all communications and images posted and sent by your children are accessible forever and can be spread without limitation, and
Opt-out of many of the social networking sites.

Cyberbullying in the workplace
Generally, there is legislation specific to problems that arise in the workplace, or from the behaviour of employees outside of the workplace. The various issues usually fall under the categories of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Although the actions and the results may be similar to those in teen cyberbullying cases, in the workplace, the term cyberbullying is not generally used. The provincial and federal human rights and employment laws apply to these behaviours when they occur in the workplace. You can refer to the Employment law and Human Rights law sections of this website for more information.
 
Can I sue someone for cyberbullying?
Yes. The reasons for bringing a civil action can include:

loss of reputation,
emotional pain and suffering,
costs of moving schools,
costs of seeking professional help (such as counsellors or legal advisors),
costs of damage done to the victim’s property as a result of the bullying, and in extreme cases,
costs for a physical assault on the victim, directly resulting from the cyberbullying.

Generally, the evidence to support the cause of the damages is the communications themselves. Electronic communications can be traced to the originator and those who participated later.
The types of remedies available include those available for other types of lawsuits, such as monetary compensation, and injunctions to stop the behaviour. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of different remedies available. For example, the person responsible for the bullying may be suspended from school, be required to write an apology to the victim, or be required to participate in an ‘anti-bullying’ program.
If the person responsible is a minor (under the age of majority), the parents of the minor may be held responsible for the damages. Most provinces have legislation, either a separate Parental Responsibility Act, or laws incorporated in their family law acts, that, to some extent, address this issue. The parents must be found to have not been acting in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Also, in such cases, the actions are often limited to the Small Claims Court, and there are usually limits placed on the amount that can be awarded by the court (sometimes below the small claims’ limits).
There may also be an action that can be brought against the school and/or the school board, if they were found to be negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities under the law. Moreover, it may be possible to sue the host of the website which facilitated the bullying.
The requirements for bringing a civil action for cyberbullying can be quite technical and extensive. Also, there are time limits for starting claims, which depend on the type of claim and who is being sued. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer as soon as possible if you are considering starting a lawsuit.
 
When is cyberbullying criminal?
In addition to civil liability, there are cases where cyberbullying may be criminal. Depending on the nature and frequency of the communications, the person responsible for the bullying may be charged with one or more of the following Criminal Code offences:

Defamatory libel
Criminal harassment
Uttering threats
Intimidation
Mischief
Unauthorized use of a computer
Identity fraud
Extortion
False messages
Counselling suicide
Incitement of hatred
Child pornography

Some of these offences are strictly indictable offences, and as such, carry serious penalties for those found guilty.

Provincial and territorial cyberbullying laws
In response to the increase of online bullying and its serious consequences, some of the provinces have introduced new cyberbullying legislation.

Alberta’s Education Act includes a definition of cyberbullying,
Manitoba’s bill ‘The Cyberbullying Prevention Act’ is currently in the legislature,
New Brunswick’s Education Act includes definitions of both online and offline bullying,
Nova Scotia’s Cyber-Safety Act was struck down on December 15, 2015 after the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that it violated Charter rights. However, the CyberSCAN investigative unit will continue to operate and victims of online bullying can still contact them for advice and help,
Ontario’s Education Act has been amended to include a section on cyberbullying and gives directions to schools on how to address it, and
Quebec amended its Education Act and the Act Respecting Private Education with An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools.

The effectiveness of the legislation, however, is still undetermined. The issue of bullying is often difficult to deal with as many students can take on the roles of bully, victim and bystander (witness). Sometimes, they engage in these roles at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to clearly define behaviours that are bullying. Similar to harassment, the behaviour can be difficult to define, but once exhibited, it is easy to spot. Numerous reports on the issue of bullying agree that it is a problem that is most effectively addressed by improving understanding of relationships, and that legislation designed to find out who the bully is and what happened, does not work either in preventing cyberbullying or dealing with it effectively once it occurs.
More information can be found from the Government of Canada’s Get Cyber Safe website, or the RCMP’s Centre for Youth Crime Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbulling.

Internet and Cyber Law,Defamation laws (cyber-libel) and the Internet,361,"
				Libel and slander, known broadly as defamation, are untrue statements made by someone that are harmful to someone else’s reputation. The statements can be about a person, business, organization, group, nation, or product that tends to hurt the person’s reputation. Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements.

Also, the false statements must be made to other people, not just to the person it is about. Libel refers to written statements and slander refers to oral statements. Under the law, both are grounds for a civil lawsuit.
Cyber-libel is a term used when someone has posted or emailed something that is untrue and damaging about someone else on the Internet, including in message boards, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, personal websites, social media, social networking sites, or other published articles. If you are suing because your reputation was damaged due to a libelous statement, you do not have to prove that it caused you financial loss because the law presumes that you suffered a financial loss as a result of the loss of your reputation.
The basic elements of defamation law remain unchanged on the Internet. Individuals or entities are still responsible for defamatory statements they publish, just as they are in print or broadcast media, and the same defences apply. Courts have also demonstrated they are not willing to allow Internet defamers to claim anonymity.
Generally, a harmful statement will not amount to libel, if one of the following defences applies:

Made only to the person it is about. If it was only made to the person mentioned in the statement, and not to anyone else;
True statements. If it is actually true, and the person making the statement makes the statement honestly and not maliciously;
Absolute privilege applies to statements made in court (as evidence in a trial) or in parliament;
Qualified privilege protects statements made non-maliciously and for well-meaning reasons. For example, if an employer is requested to give a reference for an employee, and they give a statement that is their honest opinion;
Fair comment. The defence of fair comment may apply in situations where statements made were about issues of public interest, as long the comments were honest statements of opinion, based on fact. If your statements were malicious, this defence will not apply; and
Responsible communication of matters of public interest. This defence is available in libel cases. It allows journalists the ability to report statements and allegations, in cases where there is a public interest in distributing the information to a wide audience. However, this defence only applies where the news was urgent, serious and of public importance, and the journalist used reliable sources and tried to report both sides of the issue.

In Canada, the courts have shown they are quite willing to hold responsible anyone who uses the Internet to defame others, even if the defamer is outside the country.
The flip side of Canadian courts’ willingness to hear cases involving defamation originating outside the country is that the Internet makes it even easier for plaintiffs to go “forum shopping”. Differences in the defamation laws and damages awarded in Canada, the United States, and Europe may give allegedly defamed individuals (particularly high-profile plaintiffs) pause to consider where to sue. Now, with the Internet, these plaintiffs may have an easier time making a case for their right to sue anywhere in the world.
Another concern, heightened by the Internet’s broad reach, is the issue of damages. A defamatory statement available on the Internet could arguably prompt a stratospheric damage award because of the huge, worldwide audience. Canadian courts have shown they are not willing to tie damages to the Internet’s potential audience without proper proof.

Spam is the phrase applied generally to any unwanted email. In the same way as paper-based flyers and advertisements might be considered junk mail, spam is the electronic equivalent. Until recently, most spam was not illegal in Canada nor could you do much to stop it arriving in your email inbox. However, on July 1st, 2014 Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) came into force. CASL is federal legislation that applies across Canada. Its purpose is to help protect Canadians while ensuring that businesses can continue to compete in the global marketplace.
This law directly impacts the ability of businesses to send commercial electronic messages (CEM) to customers, clients and even to other businesses. This not only includes emails, but also instant messages, text messages, and some social media communication. The CEM is defined as an electronic message whose purpose is to encourage commercial activity. That would include something involving a purchase, sale, barter or lease of goods or services. It would also include an offer to provide a business or an investment opportunity, and all advertising and promotion in that regard.

How to comply with CASL
In order to send CEMs legally, the sender must first obtain consent from the recipient. Consent can be obtained directly (called express consent) through an opt-in. This is different from other jurisdictions which have an opt-out system that allows messages to be sent until the recipients opts to no longer receive future messages. The CEM must contain the sender’s full name, and a valid email address and phone number (valid for at least 6 months from the date of sending), and an ability to unsubscribe to the electronic message.
Under the new legislation, businesses are able to rely on implied consent to send emails where there is an existing business relationship, or goods or services were purchased in the previous 2 years, or an inquiry or application was made in the last 6 months. Also, there is a three-year transitional period allowing businesses to acquire consent from customers. The law also permits businesses to send commercial messages to recipients who have published or provided their electronic address without stating that they do not wish to receive messages, if the message is relevant to their business or professional role.
There are also categories of implied consent within an already existing, non business relationship. These might include a donation, a membership in a club, or a volunteer activity. For example, if you received a business card from someone, it is likely an implied consent to send them a CEM.

Exemptions
Exemptions from compliance with CASL include CEMs:

relating to a family or personal relationship,
where a business responds to direct inquiries, requests or complaints,
within an organization, or between organizations that already have an existing relationship,
with a legal or judicial obligation attached to them,
sent by, or on behalf of, a registered charity or for fundraising purposes, or
sent by a political party, or organization.

In short, a CEM can be sent, if it applies to an existing transaction, relates to factual information about an ongoing account, relates to employment information, or deals with personal or family relationships. How does one deal with referrals? Referrals can be tricky under CASL. The person who gave the referral must have an existing relationship with the person to whom you intend to send the CEM. The CEM must include the full name of the person giving the referral and disclose that the CEM is being sent as a direct result of the referral.

Data and computer programs
The legislation prohibits the alteration of transmission of data in CEM’s without consent, and prohibits the installation of computer programs in the course of commercial activities without consent. The consents must be separate for each specific purpose. So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

So, for example, if you want to install a geo-locator, that requires a specific consent and also a separate consent from a licensing agreement.

Reporting spam, enforcement and penalties
The legislation has penalties for non-compliance, and gives individuals affected a private right of action. Individuals, businesses and other organizations can now make a complaint about receiving unsolicited emails to the Government of Canada’s Spam Reporting Centre. Legitimate complaints may then be referred to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for investigation.
Corporate directors, officers, and agents can be liable, and corporations are liable for the actions of their employees. It is important, therefore, to ensure that your company has a CASL protocol and a compliance policy in place. For corporations, fines can be up-to $100,000 for the first offence, and $250,000 for repeat offences. For individuals, fines can be $10,000 for a first offence, and $25,000 for subsequent offences. Penalties for violating the legislation can be as severe as $1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.
The right of private action comes into force on July 1, 2017. It is subject to a three-year limitation period, and the court may order up-to $1 million per day of the contravention.

What is considered impaired driving?
You do not have to exceed the legal blood alcohol limit to be charged with impaired driving. The only requirement for a charge of impaired driving is that your ability to drive was affected by alcohol or drugs, regardless of how much or how little was actually consumed.
How the police assess whether you are impaired
The police will make a judgment about your ability to drive safely based on a number of observations, including your appearance, your answers to questions, your physical movement, and whether you or your car smells of alcohol. Under the law, police have the right to stop your car and ask if you have consumed alcohol or drugs before driving. Although you are not required to answer such questions, it is generally best to avoid becoming hostile with police. You are required to provide the police with your driver’s licence, car ownership, and insurance papers.
Performing physical tests
The police have the right to request that you perform several physical tests, such as walking in a straight line, picking up a coin and following a moving finger with your eyes. You are not required to co-operate with the police, but failing to comply may lead police to suspect you are impaired. They may then demand that you provide a breath sample.
Penalties
If you are arrested for impaired driving and then you refuse to provide a breath sample or you provide a breath sample which shows that your blood alcohol level is over 80 mg, then your driver’s licence will be automatically suspended for 90 days.
If you are convicted of impaired driving, you will usually receive a fine of about $1,000 and your licence will be suspended for one year. For a second impaired driving offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three-year licence suspension. For a third or subsequent offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension, possibly a lifetime suspension. In addition, being convicted of a criminal driving offence means that you will have a criminal record.
 
Ignition Interlock condition
Along with fines, licence suspensions, or jail time, the court may also order impaired drivers to enroll in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or the Ignition Interlock Program. The Criminal Code allows each province to implement an interlock program. All provinces and territories, with the exception of Nunavut have such a program.
When using the Ignition Interlock Program, drivers must blow into an in-car alcohol breath-screening device that prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over a pre-set limit of 0.02 (i.e., 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood). The device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is connected to the engine’s ignition system.
More information about the Ignition Interlock Program is available from your provincial government.
If you were at fault for an accident and you were impaired, your automobile insurance policy will not cover damage to your vehicle and you may not be eligible to receive certain other benefits, such as income replacement benefits.
For more information on the penalties for criminal driving offences such as impaired driving, refer to the Canadian Criminal Code.
If you have been charged with a criminal driving offence, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Criminal Law,Trafficking or production (cultivation) of an illegal substance,769,"
				What is considered trafficking?
Trafficking is a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. According to the Act, trafficking in respect of an illegal drug, means:
“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”

“(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)
otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.”
Possession for the purpose of trafficking is a separate offence.

Factors that suggest trafficking
Although it is not always clear whether someone is in possession for the purpose of trafficking, the police often rely on a number of surrounding circumstances to lay a charge. For example, a person might be charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking if they have a large quantity of drugs in their possession, or if they are caught with several small packages of drugs prepared for individual sale and an accompanying list of names. In the most obvious situation, if a person is caught actually selling drugs or trying to sell drugs, they will be charged with trafficking, even if the quantity they are trying to sell is small. Importing charges will also be laid if a person is caught entering Canada with illegal drugs in their possession.

Penalties for trafficking
The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is life in prison. Most often, however, the penalty given by the court includes less jail time and probation. In deciding the severity of the penalty, the judge will consider many factors, including the type of substance being sold, (for example, marijuana vs cocaine or heroin), how much of the substance was found in the possession of the accused, and whether the accused had a prior criminal record.

What is production (cultivation) of an illegal substance?
Production of an illegal substance is also a serious offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Act states that production can include things such as:

manufacturing, synthesizing or using any means of altering the chemical or physical properties of the substance, or
cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained, and
includes an offer to produce.


Penalties for production (cultivation)
The penalties for production or cultivation of an illegal substance range from maximum jail sentences between 3 years to life, depending on the quantity and type of substance. For example, the cultivation of marijuana in large quantities now carries a maximum jail term of 14 years, whereas the production of cocaine or heroin can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Trafficking in, or the production of, an illegal substance are serious offences, with serious consequences. If you have been charged with either of these offences, you should consult a lawyer for assistance.

Another consideration is what will be done in the case of outstanding contractual obligations, such as leases or purchase orders, as well as any court actions that have already been started. Under your provincial corporations act, liabilities and actions existing before the dissolution may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved.
Although a corporation may become inactive and cease its business operations, the Articles of Incorporation remain in force until the corporation is legally dissolved. In order for the business to be permitted to become dissolved, it must be in compliance with all provincial tax statutes. If there is any tax money owing, your provincial Ministry of Finance will deny the application for dissolution. Therefore, you first must obtain proof from the Ministry of Finance that your corporation is in compliance with the tax laws and does not have any outstanding taxes. Once this is obtained, you can then proceed and your ministry or department responsible for Consumer Affairs can dissolve the corporation. You will likely need to provide copies of your Articles of Incorporation and a fee.

The franchisee has a right to use the name or trademark of the existing company and the franchisor gets to have some control over the franchisee’s business. The franchisor also has a continuing right to receive payments from the franchisee.
Advantages of owning a franchise
There are at least four advantages to owning a franchise.

You are able to operate your own business while still having the security of working with a large company.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert at running your own business because you will usually receive support from the franchisor.
For example, the franchisor may provide such things as ongoing training and business advice.
You enjoy the benefit of using the franchisor’s reputation. As a result, there is less business risk for you if the franchise has developed a successful product.
It is sometimes easier to borrow money to buy a franchise than to start an independent business.

Disadvantages of owning a franchise
There are also several disadvantages to owning a franchise. Depending on the franchisor and the franchise agreement, the franchisor may maintain a substantial amount of control over new franchises. In typical franchise situations, the franchisor will set the opening and closing times of the franchise, determine what is to be sold and how it is to be sold, and will put restrictions on the ability of the franchisee to sell his or her franchise. You should discuss these issues before you enter into a franchise agreement.
Another disadvantage of franchises is that franchisees usually have to pay an up-front fee simply to begin using the business name. To continue using the name, the franchisee will usually have to pay a set fee either every month or every year. These fees can be substantial. In exchange, the franchisee gets to use the franchise name and sell the franchise product. People will know your business name and you will not have to spend time developing a marketing plan or customer recognition of your business.
Most provinces have legislation that govern all types of franchise relationships, such as Ontario’s Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, and the New Brunswick Franchises Act. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Ontario, franchise sellers may be required to meet certain disclosure requirements and provide a full package of information on your rights and responsibilities. Visit the Canadian Franchise Association for information on legislation in your province.
There are many complicated legal issues involved in buying and operating franchises. Consult both a lawyer and an accountant when planning to enter into a franchise agreement.

Employment Law,Employment contracts,600,"
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rule","
				An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).

				Was your question answered?
			An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and employee that outlines the terms of their relationship, such as the employee’s salary and standard of service.
It should be noted that the relationship between an employer and employee is contractual even if no written document has been signed. The relationship is governed by provincial employment and labour standards legislation, as well as Occupational Health and Safety laws. These laws establish some basic conditions of the employer-employee relationship, such as an employee’s minimum wage, maximum hours of work and minimum notice for dismissal. Furthermore, the relationship is affected by common law rules, including rules dealing with unfair bargaining power and an employee’s duties of loyalty, confidentiality and good faith.
Nonetheless, many employers require prospective employees to enter into formal written employment contracts. Such contracts add a degree of certainty about the terms of the employer-employee relationship and are useful if any disputes about the employment arise.
 
Creating a valid employment contract
An employment contract, like all contracts, requires that each party provide consideration to be binding. Consideration is something of value, such as money, or, in the context of an employment agreement, the employer’s promise of a job and the employee’s promise to provide a service. Furthermore, such consideration must be provided at the time the agreement is made. An employment contract that is made with an existing employee will not be binding unless the employer provides additional consideration. A promise to continue to employ an employee is not valid consideration. However, a promotion or bonus that would not have otherwise occurred in the normal course of the relationship would be sufficient.
Another requirement is that an employment contract must be entered into voluntarily by the parties. The employer has the onus to show that the employee was able to negotiate without coercion or undue influence, particularly if some terms in the contract are harsh or restrictive. An employer might require a prospective employee to obtain independent advice to establish that the agreement was freely made. At the very least, the prospective employee should have sufficient time to read and understand the contract before being required to sign it.
 
Essential features of an employment contract
An employment contract must contain a number of features. This includes:

the names of the parties,
the date when the contract begins,
the contract’s duration, and
a description of the employee’s duties.

In addition, the contract should set out the employee’s rate of pay and how and when such payment will occur. An employment contract cannot violate the minimum statutory standards for minimum wage, timing of payment, maximum hours of work and payment for overtime.
There are also minimum statutory standards for notice of dismissal or payment in lieu of such notice. An employment contract should provide for at least as much notice as that required by legislation. If a clause breaches the statutory minimum standard for notice of dismissal, a court may replace the clause with the common law notice period, which is a much longer period than that provided by the current legislation.
Finally, an employment contract should outline a standard of performance which the employee is expected to meet and provide an employer with some flexibility to change an employee’s job description.
 
Restrictive covenants
Many employment contracts use restrictive covenants to protect the legitimate proprietary interests of an employer. Such clauses restrict the rights of a former employee to compete with their former employer and to disclose confidential information learned while on the job. The contract must outline the scope of information which is deemed to be confidential, the duration of the restrictions, and the geographic area which the restrictions cover. Furthermore, the restrictions must be reasonable, particularly in regards to geographic area and duration. An employer cannot restrict the right of a former employee to compete indefinitely.
When an employee’s position involves research or development, many employers use a clause in the employment contract which states that discoveries, improvements and other creative achievements by the employee during the course of the employment are the property of the employer.
In addition to these basic features, many employment contracts have more technical provisions that address the legal parameters of the contract. For instance, a clause might state that the contract represents the entire agreement between the employer and employee (which might prevent an employee from attempting to bind an employer to an oral promise that was not included in a subsequent contract).
Some other technical provisions sever an invalid clause from an otherwise valid contract and establish the jurisdiction for legal disputes about the contract.
There are many other aspects of the employer-employee relationship which can be addressed in an employment contract.

Municipal by-laws throughout the country, and some provincial legislation, such as Yukon’s Dog Act and Ontario’s Dog Owners’ Liability Act, make dog owners liable for any damage caused by bites to persons or other domestic animals. In British Columbia, section 49 of its Community Charter gives specific consideration to “special powers in relation to dangerous dogs”.
In serious cases, an application can be made to a court for an order to destroy or euthanize a vicious dog. The court can also order an owner to provide better control of the animal by ensuring it is on a leash, muzzled, confined to a secure area with warning signs, or prohibit owning a dog for a certain time.
Currently, only the province of Ontario and the City of Winnipeg have specifically banned “pit bulls” from being bred, imported or transferred.

Sexual harassment is a particular type of gender or sex based discrimination that occurs in employment settings. Refer to the Employment Law section of Legal Line for more information about sexual harassment.
There are situations which seem to be discriminatory but are not because human rights laws have provided an exception to the rules. For example, an ethnic social club is allowed to restrict its membership to people from its particular ethnic group. Another example is that employers are entitled to discriminate against employees who do not have a certain attribute, where that attribute is a genuine requirement of the job, such as perfect vision, certain height, or strength.

If you are in temporary financial need, many government programs can provide you with money, and help you find a job. The amount of money you may receive from each program will depend on a number of factors, including: family size, income, assets, and housing costs. Beside food and housing costs, you may also be eligible to receive a variety of other benefits such as: prescription drug and dental coverage, eyeglasses, moving or eviction costs, or employment-related costs.  If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, many provinces also offer some form of a Disability Support Program.
For more information or to apply for benefits, contact your local government office.
 
Federal financial assistance programs
The Government of Canada offers a wide range of financial benefit programs for all residents of Canada who qualify. Two of the more common of these programs are:
Employment Insurance (E.I.)  – provides Regular Benefits to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (for example, due to shortage of work, seasonal or mass lay-offs) and are available for and able to work, but can’t find a job. Visit Service Canada for more information about EI Regular Benefits.
Employment Insurance Sickness Benefits – provides Sickness Benefits to individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine.
 
Federal Disability Benefit Program
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Disability Benefit provides a monthly taxable benefit to contributors who are disabled and to their dependent children.  It is available to people who contributed recently to the Canada Pension Plan while they worked, and then became unable to work at any job on a regular basis because of a “severe” and “prolonged” disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the CPP Disability Benefit if first: your disability meets the definition under CPP legislation, and second, you have made enough contributions into the CPP while you were working. Eligibility also depends upon whether:

you are under age 65;
you stopped working because of your medical condition; and
when you were working you paid into the CPP for at least four of the last six years, or you paid into the CPP for at least 25 years and made valid contributions to the Plan in three of the last six years.

In contrast to lawyers and paralegals, the authority of a notary public is simply to verify that “signatures, marks and copies of documents are true or genuine”.
Notaries public are governed by their provincial or territorial notaries acts. Unlike lawyers and paralegals, they do not have to undergo special education or training, and a notary public is not required to carry professional liability insurance as they do not provide legal advice.
 
Lawyers
Lawyers may work for private law firms, legal aid, as Crown prosecutors, or in offices at the federal, provincial and municipal level of government, as well as for businesses.
Lawyers must complete years of university education and practical training. Lawyers, generally must have completed an undergraduate degree as well as either a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a Juris Doctor (J.D.) or the equivalent degree approved by the Law Society. In addition, lawyers must complete a Licensing Program which includes examinations, and an Articling Program (working with a lawyer). They are governed by their provincial Law Society which establishes and enforces standards of conduct, credentials, education and client protection that all lawyers must meet to practice law.
Lawyers can help in all types of legal matters, including:

Family matters, such as divorce, separation agreements and custody issues;
Criminal matters at all levels of court;
Civil litigation matters at all levels of court;
Wills, powers of attorney and estate matters;
Real estate matters, including buying and selling residential or commercial property; and
Administrative law matters, including hearings before tribunals.

 
Paralegals
Formerly referred to as a “Legal Assistant”, paralegals usually have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes at a community college. They are capable of independent legal work, performed subject to the general supervision of a lawyer. A paralegal, like a lawyer, can be employed by a law office or work freelance.
An unlicensed paralegal is supervised by a lawyer and cannot engage in the practice of law. Usually, paralegals prepare legal documents, maintain records and files and conduct research to assist lawyers or other professionals. Independent paralegals provide legal services to the public as allowed by government legislation, or provide paralegal services on contract to law firms or other establishments. Specific job titles associated with paralegals include:

corporate paralegal
family law paralegal
independent paralegal
senior paralegal
litigation paralegal
land titles examiner
legal technician
legal assistant
legal researcher
notary public
law clerk
title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
The procedure to become a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits, differs by province and territory. In Ontario, you must complete an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. In Manitoba, the application is made with the Minister of Finance, and in Alberta, notary public appointments are made by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
For help in deciding whether a lawyer or a paralegal is the right professional for your situation, visit your provincial or territorial Law Society. For more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits contact your provincial government office.

title searcher

A paralegal may perform a number of tasks, including:

Drafting documents for proceedings
Negotiating on behalf of clients at a proceeding
Representing clients in authorized courts
Drafting documents under a lawyer’s supervision
Conducting legal research

Currently, Ontario is the only province where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court by the Law Society. Licensed paralegals can only perform legal services within a defined scope. They are authorized to represent clients in matters such as provincial offences (traffic tickets, etc.), landlord & tenant disputes, Small Claims Court, and certain limited criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.
Typically, paralegals’ fees are often lower than those of lawyers. This makes them a good alternative for people with legal needs appropriate for a paralegal to handle, and who have difficulties affording lawyers’ fees.
 
Notaries public and commissioners for taking affidavits
Along with the role of verifying signatures, marks and copies of documents (such as Wills and Powers of Attorneys) as being true or genuine, a notary public also has all the powers of a commissioner for taking affidavits (also referred to as oaths). An affidavit or oath is a written statement or declaration of facts that are sworn or affirmed to be true. A commissioner for taking affidavits may take affidavits as well as administer other affirmations or declarations in all parts of Canada, or subject to any limit placed upon them by their provincial or territorial Attorney General.
In most of Canada, notaries public have a scope of practice that is far more limited than lawyers and paralegals, with the exception of Quebec and British Columbia. In British Columbia, notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and exercise far greater power than the rest of Canada, as they are able to dispense legal advice and draft public documents such as mortgages and other contractual documents. In Quebec, the term notaries refers to those who are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar and may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.
The procedure to become a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits, differs by province and territory. In Ontario, you must complete an application with the Ministry of the Attorney General. In Manitoba, the application is made with the Minister of Finance, and in Alberta, notary public appointments are made by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General.
For help in deciding whether a lawyer or a paralegal is the right professional for your situation, visit your provincial or territorial Law Society. For more information on becoming a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits contact your provincial government office.

Family Law,Spousal support,118,"
				Spousal support is money paid by one spouse to the other following a separation or divorce. Its general purpose is to compensate one spouse for any financial losses suffered as a result of the marriage and to assist that spouse until they become financially independent. It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couple","

It is not intended to punish or blame one spouse for the breakdown of the relationship. Spousal support can either be agreed to between the spouses or set by the courts.
 
Who is entitled to spousal support?
Spouses who were both legally married and divorced are entitled to spousal support according to the laws set out in the federal Divorce Act. Provincial and territorial laws decide the rules for legally married couples who separate, but who are not divorcing, and for unmarried couples who were in a common-law relationship.
Unmarried couples in a common-law relationship
Generally, spouses who are not married, may still have rights to financial support if they qualify as a spouse under provincial family law legislation. For example,

Alberta requires that the couple must have been in an adult interdependent relationship (AIP), which applies if the couple entered into a written AIP agreement, or had been living together for three years, or had been living together in a relationship of some permanence but have a child together;
in British Columbia the couple must have been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or less than two years but have a child together;
in Nova Scotia the couple must have either been living together in a common-law relationship for two years, or have registered their relationship as a Domestic Partnership with the Vital Statistics Office;
in New Brunswick the couple must have either been living together for three years and one person must have been substantially dependant on the other for support, or they must have been living together for one year and have a child together;
in Manitoba, the couple must have been living together in a conjugal relationship for three years, or less than three years but have a child together; or have registered their common-law relationship with the Vital Statistics Agency;
in Ontario the couple must have either been living together for three years, or have a child together and been living together in a relationship of some permanence; and
in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories the couple must have been living together for at least two years, or, less than two years but have a child together in NWT.

Time limits to file a common-law spousal support claim
In some provinces and territories there is no time limit for when a claim for spousal support must be made. However,  in some cases, such as in British Columbia, the claim for spousal support must be made within two years. In Yukon, where a couple must have been living in a relationship of some permanence to have rights to support, the claim for support must be made within only three months of the separation.
How does the law apply in Quebec?
In Quebec, common-law partners (called de facto couples under Quebec law) are not entitled to spousal support when they separate, as it is the only province that has not recognized common-law relationships as a form of marriage.
 
What determines if spousal support should be awarded?
Spousal support is not available for everyone, and will depend on several different factors. However, it is often awarded where there is a significant difference in the incomes of the spouses.
Specific factors that are considered when deciding if a spouse should get support include:

the financial means and needs of both spouses;
the length of the marriage;
the roles of each spouse during their marriage;
the effect of those roles and the breakdown of the marriage on both spouses’ current financial positions;
the care of the children;
the goal of encouraging a spouse who receives support to be self-sufficient in a reasonable period of time; and
any orders, agreements or arrangements already made about spousal support.

 
How is the amount of spousal support determined?
The amount of spousal support generally depends on the need of the spouse seeking support, the ability of the other spouse to pay and what kind of lifestyle and standard of living the spouses enjoyed during the marriage. Though spousal support can be a lump-sum payment, most of the time it is an ongoing weekly or monthly payment.
Judges sometimes use the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines to help decide how much spousal support should be paid and for how long. These Guidelines are informal, and are not legislated. The Guidelines are not used to determine if a spouse is entitled to support, but only as a reference tool when deciding the amount of spousal support.
The Guidelines are based on income sharing formulas, meaning that spousal support is determined as a percentage of the difference between the spouses’ incomes. The percentage may vary according to a number of factors, such as the length of the marriage, the age of the recipient spouse, and whether there are any children of the marriage. The Guidelines will give a range of support amounts to consider once all the information has been gathered and a calculation has been done.
The extent of the obligation to pay spousal support will depend on many different factors. Where the marriage had been of short duration it is more likely that any support ordered will be of short duration. Where both spouses worked throughout the marriage any support ordered may be for a limited term. On the other hand, where the marriage was a traditional marriage in the sense that the wife remained in the home, raising the children without significant employment outside the home, the support obligation may be without time limitation.
Changing the amount of spousal support
After a court makes a spousal support order, generally either spouse can apply to have it increased or decreased if there has been a material change in circumstances. For example, you may be able to reduce your payments if you recently lost your job, or if your ex-spouse recently remarried or was able to get a job. Much will depend on the circumstances of each case and whether the material change was foreseeable. This is an area where legal advice should be sought before making an application.
 
Payment of both child and spousal support
If either spouse is paying child support, a judge must determine how the payment of spousal support would affect child support payments. The Divorce Act states that a judge must give priority to child support when a person applies for both child and spousal support.
 
Tax treatment of spousal support payments
Generally, support payments are deductible by the payer and taxable to the spouse receiving the payments, if:

the order or agreement clearly state the amount to be paid for the spouse, or common-law partner; and
all payments for child support are fully paid for the current and previous years.

 
Getting assistance
Since spousal support is assessed on a case-by-case basis, it is important to know your rights and obligations. A lawyer can help you determine whether spousal support should be paid and in what amount.
For more information regarding federal spousal support legislation, visit the Department of Justice.  For more information about spousal support laws where you live, visit your provincial or territorial Ministry of Justice or Attorney General.

Business Law,Importing and exporting,236,"
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account befo","
				If you plan to import or export goods for commercial purposes, there are several regulations and procedures you must follow. The following is a general overview about the requirements for importing and exporting goods to Canada.

Importing
Business Number and import / export account information
All businesses that want to import goods to Canada on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number (BN) from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and also complete the Import/Export Account Information form. These forms are available online from the CRA website. CRA will use your import-export account number to process customs documents. It is a good idea, therefore, to register for your account before you try importing goods into Canada, thereby avoiding delays and confusion at the border. For more information and registration forms, visit Canada Revenue Agency.
Identify imports and their value
Importers must know what items they are importing and the country of origin of the items. They must also provide CRA with an invoice that shows the value of the goods they are importing. CRA will then classify and value the goods according to an international description and coding system, called the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Canada’s Customs Tariff is based on this system.
The Government classifies imports to compile trade statistics and to determine whether any conditions apply to the imports, such as prohibitions, quotas, anti-dumping, countervailing duties, NAFTA provisions, or other preferential tariff treatments. If any of these conditions apply to your imports, it may affect the quantity of goods you are allowed to import. There are about 21 main classifications of imports with further classifications within the main headings. You can obtain detailed information and lists of the classifications from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA also offers advance rulings for tariff classification, which provide binding, written advice as to the classification of a product. This can be very helpful to determine before you go to the trouble of trying to import something only to have it refused at the border.
Permits
Depending on the goods you plan to import, you may also require an Import Permit. Controlled substances such as textiles, clothing, agricultural products, and footwear will require a permit. The Export and Import Controls Bureau of Global Affairs Canada can help you determine what permits and documents you will need.
Government programs
You may also be eligible to participate in a variety of government programs or services for importing businesses, such as pre-clearance programs, and duty deferral.
Also, it is advisable to consult with CBSA. Their Electronic Commerce Client Requirements Document provides information about business and system requirements for multiple import and export programs. For more information, visit CBSA.
Importing goods to Canada for the first time can be a very daunting endeavour. Importers may choose to hire a customs broker to represent them in their dealings with CRA, and to give them advice on the procedures and requirements. Only customs brokers who have been licensed by CRA are authorized to account for goods and pay duties and taxes.
 
Exporting
There are a variety of government programs and services that can help you start or expand an export business. The programs and services include training and preparedness programs, trade information, export counselling, trade and statistical information, export financing, and regulations information. You can obtain more information about these services from a Canada-Regional Business Service Centre or from Canada Business Network.
As with all Canadian businesses, those who export on a commercial basis must obtain a Business Number from CRA.
If you export a commercial shipment that is valued at $2,000 or more to a foreign country other than the United States, you must fill out an Export Declaration. If you ship controlled, regulated, or prohibited goods, you must submit a permit or certificate. If you are a registered exporter, you can report goods electronically to the federal government of Canada.
You can obtain more information about the goods or countries that require an export permit from the Export and Import Controls Division Bureau of Global Affairs Canada.
If you require legal advice or assistance, contact a lawyer.

If you are selling your home, a real estate agent can help you determine the fair market value, advertise your home to potential buyers, arrange for interested buyers to view your home, and guide you through the process of negotiating an agreement.
Most sellers sign a listing agreement with their real estate agent. This is a written contract between the seller and the real estate agent that sets out most of the duties and obligations of the relationship. It includes how the real estate agents will market the property and how much they will be paid for their services. In most cases, real estate agents are paid a commission, or percentage of the selling price. Commissions can vary from about 3% to 8%. If your property does not sell, you do not have to pay anything.
 
What does a Real Estate Agent do for a buyer?
If you are buying a home, a real estate agent can help you find the right type of home at the right price, help prepare your offer to purchase, and present your offer to the owners. In most cases, there is no direct cost to a purchaser for the agent’s services. The agent you work with will normally be paid part of the commission paid to the listing agent. In law, both the listing agent and the purchaser’s real estate agent are working for the seller.
Unlike a seller, a buyer does not normally sign a written agreement with a real estate agent. However, there is a growing trend in many areas for real estate agents to ask buyers to sign what is called a Buyer Agency Agreement or a Buyer Representation Agreement. These agreements generally commit purchasers to use only one agent for their purchase. Although agents with this type of agreement may provide better service to the purchasers, it is not usually necessary to sign a purchaser agency agreement.
 
Obligations of Real Estate Agents
Real estate agents are held to certain standards and ethics under provincial laws, such as the Manitoba Real Estate Brokers Act, the Alberta Real Estate Act, or the Real Estate Services Act in British Columbia. Overall, they are required to use reasonable care when carrying out all their duties. For example, they must perform the obligations in their agreement, and they must present all offers from potential buyers to the seller. Real estate agents must also be completely honest at all times, and must always follow your instructions. If you have a complaint about a real estate agent, you can contact the real estate board in your area for more information.
 
Do you need a Real Estate Agent?
There is no legal requirement for home buyers and sellers to hire real estate agents. However, most people prefer the services and assistance of a professional. If you decide to contact a real estate agent, make sure you select someone you trust who has a good reputation and who is familiar with your neighbourhood and type of home. If you do not use a real estate agent, you can have a lawyer review any ‘offers to purchase’ or draft your offer.
Although most real estate agents can explain the basics of an Agreement of Purchase and Sale, you should have a real estate lawyer review the agreement before you sign it.

Real Estate Law,Surveys: Detailed property drawings,393,"
				What are surveys?
A survey is a detailed drawing of a property, including the exact dimensions of the land and location of buildings, fences, driveways and adjacent roads. It will also show easements (a legally enforceable right-of-way) that utility companies, neighbours, or others may have over the property.
A survey can be very important to a purchaser because it shows whether the size of the property stated on the listing and in the purchase agreement is accurate. It will also show whether the property’s buildings encroach onto adjoining properties, whether the neighbour’s buildings come onto your property, and whether the property conforms to municipal requirements, such as the mini","

A survey can be very important to a purchaser because it shows whether the size of the property stated on the listing and in the purchase agreement is accurate. It will also show whether the property’s buildings encroach onto adjoining properties, whether the neighbour’s buildings come onto your property, and whether the property conforms to municipal requirements, such as the minimum distances of buildings from the property line or street.
A fairly recent survey is often required by your financial institution if you are taking out a mortgage loan to finance the purchase of your home. In many cases, a survey that is 15 or 20 years old will be sufficient, as long as there have been no significant changes to the property. Also, in lieu of or in addition to a survey, lenders will require the purchaser to purchase title insurance.
If you are buying a home, ask whether the sellers already have a survey. If they do, you can include a clause in your offer that the seller must provide you or your lawyer with the survey shortly after the agreement is accepted. If the seller does not have a survey, you may want to include a clause that the seller provide you with an up-to-date survey at the seller’s cost. If you are purchasing a new home, the builder will usually provide you with a copy of the survey. Make sure, however, that this is written into the purchase agreement.
 
What if I need a new survey?
Even if you purchase title insurance, if there is no recent survey for the property you are purchasing, you may want to have a new survey prepared for other reasons, such as to ensure that a proposed fence is being built in the right place, or if you want to build a structure, that set back laws are being complied with. A survey can cost from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the size and shape of the property and the number of buildings or other improvements on it. If you do not know a professional land surveyor, your lawyer or real estate agent can usually refer one to you.

A survey is a detailed drawing of a property, including the exact dimensions of the land and location of buildings, fences, driveways and adjacent roads. It will also show easements (a legally enforceable right-of-way) that utility companies, neighbours, or others may have over the property.
A survey can be very important to a purchaser because it shows whether the size of the property stated on the listing and in the purchase agreement is accurate. It will also show whether the property’s buildings encroach onto adjoining properties, whether the neighbour’s buildings come onto your property, and whether the property conforms to municipal requirements, such as the minimum distances of buildings from the property line or street.
A fairly recent survey is often required by your financial institution if you are taking out a mortgage loan to finance the purchase of your home. In many cases, a survey that is 15 or 20 years old will be sufficient, as long as there have been no significant changes to the property. Also, in lieu of or in addition to a survey, lenders will require the purchaser to purchase title insurance.
If you are buying a home, ask whether the sellers already have a survey. If they do, you can include a clause in your offer that the seller must provide you or your lawyer with the survey shortly after the agreement is accepted. If the seller does not have a survey, you may want to include a clause that the seller provide you with an up-to-date survey at the seller’s cost. If you are purchasing a new home, the builder will usually provide you with a copy of the survey. Make sure, however, that this is written into the purchase agreement.
 
What if I need a new survey?
Even if you purchase title insurance, if there is no recent survey for the property you are purchasing, you may want to have a new survey prepared for other reasons, such as to ensure that a proposed fence is being built in the right place, or if you want to build a structure, that set back laws are being complied with. A survey can cost from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the size and shape of the property and the number of buildings or other improvements on it. If you do not know a professional land surveyor, your lawyer or real estate agent can usually refer one to you.

Real Estate Law,Agreement of Purchase and Sale,389,"
				An Agreement of Purchase and Sale is a written contract between a seller and a buyer for the purchase and sale of a particular property. In the Agreement, the buyer agrees to purchase the property for a certain price, provided that a number of terms and conditions are satisfied. The process begins when the purchaser makes an offer, which is irrevocable for a certain time-period. If there are no counter-offers, the Agreement becomes a legally binding agreement if the offer is accepted by the seller, within the time-period set by the buyer. At this point, the Agreement cannot be cancelled unless both the buyer and the seller agree.

If there are no counter-offers, the Agreement becomes a legally binding agreement if the offer is accepted by the seller, within the time-period set by the buyer. At this point, the Agreement cannot be cancelled unless both the buyer and the seller agree.
Because all agreements for the purchase and sale of land must be in writing to be legally enforceable, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale provides a general layout for for addressing the main issues. Most local real estate boards and provincial real estate associations have established standard form Agreements of Purchase and Sale. Although these forms contain standard terms and conditions, the Agreement can be changed if both the buyer and the seller agree and write their initials alongside any additions or deletions.
Overview of the terms contained in the Agreement
Most standard form Agreements begin with some basic information about the buyer, the seller, and the property in question. There will also be an area to record the purchase price being offered by the buyer, and the deposit being paid by the buyer to the seller’s real estate agent in trust for the seller. The exact date and time that the offer is open (and irrevocable) is also specified. It is usually a few hours or days. If the offer to buy the property is not accepted by the seller before that date, it will become void.
 
Fixtures and chattels
The Agreement also deals with fixtures and chattels.  Fixtures are generally improvements made to a property that are attached or cannot be removed easily without causing damage to the property. Hot water heaters, built-in cabinets, and lights are examples of fixtures. Fixtures are assumed to be included in the sale of the home, unless they are specifically excluded in the Agreement.
Chattels are moveable items of personal property contained on the property and must specifically be listed in the Agreement if they are to be part of the sale of the home. For example, if the seller agrees to include a refrigerator, stove, or gardening equipment in the sale, these items must be specifically identified in the Agreement. If there is any doubt whether an item is included or excluded, it should be clearly specified in the Agreement.
Title and other searches, closing arrangements, and completion date
Included in the Agreement are clauses dealing with:
The requisition date, which is the time within which the purchaser has to examine the title, and complete all other searches. It is generally set for 15 days to one month before the closing date of the transaction. Before this date, it is the purchaser’s responsibility to do a number of searches to ensure that there are no problems with the property. These are usually handled by the purchaser’s lawyer, and include things such as searching the registered ownership of the property with the land registry, checking that the property complies with zoning regulations, and searching for any outstanding municipal work orders.
The closing arrangements and completion date is when all relevant documents are exchanged by the parties’ lawyers and the sale is finalized. This is the date that the seller must give vacant possession of the property to the purchaser.
 
Conditions
Most Agreements also establish a number of conditions and any special arrangements they are agreeing to. Common conditions include:

That the buyer’s entire offer to purchase the home is conditional on the seller being the legal and registered owner of the property,
If the buyer’s lawyer discovers any problems while doing the various document searches, the buyer must send a letter to the seller’s lawyer before the requisition deadline explaining the problem. If the seller is unable to fix the problem, then the entire agreement may come to an end unless the buyer chooses to take the property with the particular defect,
That unless the buyer makes an objection in writing before the requisition date, the buyer cannot later complain about any defects in the seller’s ownership of the property. For this reason, it is very important for the buyer’s lawyer to perform all the necessary searches to ensure that there are no hidden problems that may arise at a later date,
The buyer may agree to assume the seller’s existing mortgage, rather than arranging separate financing through a bank,
That the agreement is conditional on the sale of the purchaser’s current home, or on the purchaser arranging financing,
That the seller provide a survey of the property,
In the case of a condominium purchase, that a Status Certificate be provided, and
That the offer can be voided by the purchaser if problems are discovered during a home inspection.

 
Standard clauses
The remaining clauses in the Agreement deal with a number of technical issues in relation to the future use of the property, the production of documents, insurance, the Planning Act, tax arrangements, adjustments, spousal consent, and other standard clauses. Your lawyer or real estate agent can provide a more detailed explanation of these terms.
Completing an Agreement of Purchase and Sale can be complicated and technical. Before the Agreement becomes final, it may get modified as the result of negotiations between the buyer and the seller, and counter-offers presented to the buyer by the seller. To be certain that you understand all the terms of the Agreement, it is best to have your Agreement reviewed by a lawyer before your purchase or sale of land is finalized.

Most commonly, buyers will offer to purchase provided they are able to sell their current home or arrange suitable mortgage financing. A buyer may also include a condition to buy the home subject to a satisfactory home inspection, or subject to a zoning change or other municipal approval. To be legally binding, the condition must be specifically written into the offer to purchase.
Conditional offers can very effectively reduce risks for the purchaser. They are less attractive to sellers, however, and may not be accepted.
 
Counter-offers
In reply to a conditional offer, the seller might make a counter-offer instead of simply refusing the conditional offer. A counter-offer will usually agree with some of the conditions wanted by the prospective buyer, but exclude the rest. If the seller’s counter-offer is accepted by the buyer, the agreement becomes legally binding.
Offers may go back and forth several times before a deal is finally reached. The legal issues can become complicated. It is advisable to seek the assistance of your real estate agent and your lawyer in preparing either a conditional offer or a counter-offer.

				Buying a new home or a resale home
There are a number of differences between buying a new home and buying a resale home. A new home is one that has just been built. You might buy a new home from a contractor who has already built the home, or you might hire a contractor to build it for you. A previously-owned home, often called a resale home, has already been lived in. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.
When buying a new home:

You might buy a new home from a contractor who has already built the home, or you might hire a contractor to build it for you. A previously-owned home, often called a resale home, has already been lived in. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.
When buying a new home:

it may have the most current materials and features, and the purchaser may be able to choose certain features such as flooring, cabinets and electrical fixtures;
the purchaser may have to pay extra for certain features, such as a fireplace, or trees;
certain taxes may be added to the cost of the home, such as the GST, or HST (in Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador); and
a warranty may be provided by the builder of the home, and New Home Warranties are provided by provincial governments.

When buying a resale home:

purchasers can see what they are buying;
landscaping is usually done and other extras such as a pool or a finished basement may already exist;
buyers do not have to pay the GST/HST unless the house has been renovated substantially, and then the taxes are applied as if it were a new home; and
renovations may need to be done, as well as major repairs such as replacing the roof or windows.

 
New home purchase agreements
Another difference when purchasing a new home is that the offer to purchase is considerably longer and more complicated than a resale Agreement of Purchase and Sale. In addition, the text is often written in very small print and there is not much space to make changes. For this reason, it is important to take the offer to a lawyer before signing it. Your lawyer will explain the agreement to you to ensure that it is acceptable. With your lawyer’s advice and assistance, you may also be able to delete or change terms that are heavily weighted in favour of the builder.
If you are unable to consult a lawyer before signing the offer, you may choose to insert a written clause into the contract stating that your acceptance is conditional on your lawyer reviewing the agreement and finding it satisfactory. Some builders will not accept agreements with substantial changes to the standard clauses. In these circumstances, it is important to assess the reputation of the builder and how past purchasers have been dealt with.
 
Delays and extensions to the closing date
When buying a new home which is being built for you, be prepared for possible delays and complications. Although many new homes are complete and ready to move into by the scheduled closing date, it is not unusual for the closing date to be delayed or extended. This can happen because of strikes, shortages of labour or materials, or the builder’s inability to meet the original delivery date.
New home buyers generally have less certainty about closing dates and moving dates. Usually, a delay does not automatically void or cancel an agreement between a buyer and a builder. Almost all builder contracts include a clause that allows the automatic extension of a closing date for up to 120 days. After 120 days, buyers then have a 10-day window to cancel the entire contract. If the buyer chooses not to cancel the contract, the closing date can be extended again for another 120 days. Once this second 120 days has elapsed, the contract is automatically cancelled unless both the buyer and the builder agree to further extend the closing date.
Deposit protection and warranties
In all provinces except the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the Yukon, all newly constructed homes and condominiums must be enrolled in a New Home Warranty Program. In addition to setting specific guidelines for how builders must deal with purchasers, the most important part of the program is the insurance plan. This protects purchasers from having to live in an unfinished or structurally defective home if the builder is unable or unwilling to complete the work that needs to be done. It also protects purchasers from unauthorized substitutions of materials, and from losing their deposits up to a specific amount (ranging from $10,000 to $60,000, depending on the province) if the builder goes bankrupt.
Purchasers usually have to pay an enrollment fee, ranging from $500 to $1,000, depending on the purchase price of the property. If a builder fails to honour its warranty for service and repair, the cost or repairs may be covered by the Warranty Program. For certain problems, the buyer may be able to make a claim for compensation against the Program rather than having to sue the builder.
Depending on your region’s or province’s Warranty Program, you can receive coverage for anywhere from 5 to 10 years. During the first year, the builder is generally responsible for repairing defects in material or quality of work. During the remaining years, the builder is typically responsible for repairing any major structural defects in construction that significantly affect the use of the home.
If for any reason the builder is unable or unwilling to return to make the necessary repairs, the Warranty Program will pay for someone else to handle the repairs. Buyers of new homes should be aware, though, that the Warranty Program does not cover every kind of defect in a new home, such as normal wear and tear or defects in cabinetry or appliances installed by the homeowner. These programs also do not typically cover cottages, homes built on existing footings or foundations, converted buildings, homes lived in or rented by the builder before they are sold, or homes built by their owners.
New home protection legislation by province:
Alberta:  New Home Buyer Protection Act,  Municipal Affairs Alberta
British Columbia:  Homeowner Protection Act, Homeowner Protection Office
Manitoba:  The New Home Warranty Act, Government of Manitoba
New Brunswick:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but some builders may offer their own home warranty or warranties through third-party home warranty programs
Newfoundland and Labrador:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but some builders may offer warranties through third-party home warranty programs
Northwest Territories:  No legislation that require developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, and no new home warranty programs
Nova Scotia:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but some builders may offer their own home warranty or warranties through third-party home warranty programs
Nunavut:  No legislation that require developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, and no new home warranty programs
Ontario:  New Home Warranties Plan Act, Ministry of Government and Consumer Services
Prince Edward Island:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but some builders may offer their own home warranty or warranties through third-party home warranty programs
Quebec:  Developers must provide a new home warranty to buyers only if the building has no more than four units stacked one above the other, and buyers are also covered by the Civil Code of Quebec, which provides a five-year warranty (after building completion) against hidden defects
Saskatchewan:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but there are several privately run new home warranty programs
Yukon:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, and no new home warranty programs
 
Additional costs
Buyers should also be advised of a number of additional costs involved in new home purchases. In addition to the Warranty Program enrollment fee, GST or HST, depending on the province or territory, is payable on new homes. In many cases, this is already included in the purchase price. Since this is a very significant expense, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale should clearly state if the GST or HST is included and how any rebates are to be handled.
Other extra charges in new homes can include lot levies, sewer impost charges, hydro meter installation, curb charges, gas hook-up charges, water hook-up charges, tree charges, and super mailbox charges. If you are buying a new house, be sure you know what is included and the additional costs you will be responsible for on closing.
Buying a new home is usually more complicated than buying a resale home. Your real estate lawyer will be able to answer questions relating to your new home purchase.

If for any reason the builder is unable or unwilling to return to make the necessary repairs, the Warranty Program will pay for someone else to handle the repairs. Buyers of new homes should be aware, though, that the Warranty Program does not cover every kind of defect in a new home, such as normal wear and tear or defects in cabinetry or appliances installed by the homeowner. These programs also do not typically cover cottages, homes built on existing footings or foundations, converted buildings, homes lived in or rented by the builder before they are sold, or homes built by their owners.
New home protection legislation by province:
Alberta:  New Home Buyer Protection Act,  Municipal Affairs Alberta
British Columbia:  Homeowner Protection Act, Homeowner Protection Office
Manitoba:  The New Home Warranty Act, Government of Manitoba
New Brunswick:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but some builders may offer their own home warranty or warranties through third-party home warranty programs
Newfoundland and Labrador:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but some builders may offer warranties through third-party home warranty programs
Northwest Territories:  No legislation that require developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, and no new home warranty programs
Nova Scotia:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but some builders may offer their own home warranty or warranties through third-party home warranty programs
Nunavut:  No legislation that require developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, and no new home warranty programs
Ontario:  New Home Warranties Plan Act, Ministry of Government and Consumer Services
Prince Edward Island:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but some builders may offer their own home warranty or warranties through third-party home warranty programs
Quebec:  Developers must provide a new home warranty to buyers only if the building has no more than four units stacked one above the other, and buyers are also covered by the Civil Code of Quebec, which provides a five-year warranty (after building completion) against hidden defects
Saskatchewan:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, but there are several privately run new home warranty programs
Yukon:  No legislation that requires developers to provide new home warranty to buyers, and no new home warranty programs
 
Additional costs
Buyers should also be advised of a number of additional costs involved in new home purchases. In addition to the Warranty Program enrollment fee, GST or HST, depending on the province or territory, is payable on new homes. In many cases, this is already included in the purchase price. Since this is a very significant expense, the Agreement of Purchase and Sale should clearly state if the GST or HST is included and how any rebates are to be handled.
Other extra charges in new homes can include lot levies, sewer impost charges, hydro meter installation, curb charges, gas hook-up charges, water hook-up charges, tree charges, and super mailbox charges. If you are buying a new house, be sure you know what is included and the additional costs you will be responsible for on closing.
Buying a new home is usually more complicated than buying a resale home. Your real estate lawyer will be able to answer questions relating to your new home purchase.

As well, mortgage loan insurance is available from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

As well, mortgage loan insurance is available from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
First-time Home Buyers’ Tax Credit (FTHB)
The First-time Home Buyers’ Tax Credit exists to assist first-time home buyers with the costs associated with the purchase of a home, such as legal fees, disbursements and land transfer taxes. The FTHB is a $5,000 non-refundable income tax credit amount on a qualifying home acquired after January 27, 2009. For an eligible individual, the maximum credit amount is $750. You are considered eligible if: 1) you or your spouse or common-law partner acquired a qualifying home; and 2) you did not live in another home owned by you or your spouse or common-law partner in the year of acquisition or in any of the four preceding years.
 
Home Buyers’ Plan (HBP)
The Home Buyers’ Plan allows first-time home buyers to withdraw up to $25,000 from their RRSPs on a tax deferred basis to use toward the purchase of a home in Canada. To qualify as a first-time home buyer, purchasers must not have lived in a home owned by themselves or their spouses or common-law partners in the last five years. If both you and your spouse or common-law partner qualify under the Plan, you can each withdraw up to $25,000 from your RRSPs for a total of $50,000.
Before you are entitled to withdraw the money from your RRSP, you must have entered into a written agreement to purchase or build a home that you intend to occupy as your principal residence. The purchase of a cottage or a commercial property, for example, would not qualify for this program because they are not a principal residence.
Money can be withdrawn from your RRSP provided it has been in your RRSP for at least 90 days. If you have signed an Agreement of Purchase and Sale and you have at least 90 days until your closing, you can open an RRSP and make a contribution, receive the tax deferred benefit and then withdraw the same money and put it toward the purchase of your home.
Money withdrawn under this federal program must be paid back to your RRSP within 15 years. People generally deposit one fifteenth of the amount withdrawn back to the RRSP over each of the following 15 years. If you do not pay the full amount back to your RRSP within 15 years, the amount outstanding will be subject to tax when you file your income tax return in the following year.
 
Mortgage loan insurance
Mortgage loan insurance, available from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, is usually required by mortgage lenders when home buyers make a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price of their new home.
Mortgage loan insurance helps protect the lender against mortgage default, and enables consumers to purchase homes with a minimum down payment of:

5% for homes costing up-to $500,000
10% on the portion of any mortgage it insures over $500,000

For example, to buy a home for $750,000, the home buyer would need a minimum down payment of $50,000, which is the total of 5% of $500,000 ($25,000), plus 10% of the remaining $250,000 ($25,000).
To obtain mortgage loan insurance, lenders pay an insurance premium, the cost of which is normally passed on to the home buyer. The premium payable is based on a percentage of the home’s purchase price that is financed by a mortgage. The premium can be paid in a single lump-sum or it can be added to the mortgage and included in the monthly payments.
For more information about mortgage loan insurance, visit Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
Land Transfer Tax refunds
First-time home buyers may be eligible for a refund of all or part of the land transfer tax payable. Whether you qualify or not will depend on the criteria set by the province. To determine if you qualify for a rebate, you should consult a lawyer. More information can also be found from your provincial or territorial Ministry of Finance.
 
Provincial Home Ownership Savings Plan
Nova Scotia offers first-time home buyers a Home Ownership Savings Plan. This program provides a tax credit for contributions up to specified amounts each year. The savings you accumulate can then be used toward the purchase of a home. To qualify, you must earn less than $40,000, or if you have a spouse, your combined income must be less than $80,000. For more information about this program, speak with a lawyer or real estate agent, or visit novascotia.ca to view the Home Ownership Plan Tax Credit Regulations.

In other words, a tenant in common can leave their share of the property to whomever they wish in their Will because it does not automatically belong to the other tenant in common.
 
What is title insurance?
Although title insurance is not required in Canada, it is a good option for homebuyers who seek additional protection when purchasing a home. Buyers can buy an insurance policy, which will compensate them if there is a problem with the title, including zoning problems or ownership issues. Title insurance can be purchased from a number of licensed providers. 
Whether you are buying a residential or commercial property, you are essentially buying the legal ownership, or title. Lawyers perform a number of administrative searches to ensure that buyers do in fact receive full legal title. Title insurance is an alternative to conducting a number of administrative searches. It is important to remember that title insurance does not cover all risks and does not replace legal advice when purchasing property.
The types of properties that can be insured include almost every kind of property, such as: houses, condominiums, cottages, rental units, vacant land, office buildings, shopping centres, warehouses and so on.
 
What is covered by title insurance?
Depending on the type of policy that is purchased, title insurance can cover such situations as:

zoning problems,
major outstanding work orders or liens against the property,
liens resulting from unpaid debts, such as utilities, mortgages, property taxes, condominium fees, etc.,
errors in surveys and public records,
lawyer error, and
title fraud.

It is interesting to note that many people who already own their homes and have paid off their mortgage are now buying title insurance as a means to safeguard themselves against title fraud. This occurs when fraudsters purport to be the owner of a property, or using stolen personal information of the real owner, transfer ownership to themselves. After doing this, the fraudsters then take out a mortgage on the property and abscond with the money. This tends to happen in cases where there is no existing mortgage on the property because it is easier to get a first mortgage from the bank.
With title insurance, because it is an insurance product, it is not necessary for the policyholder to prove negligence. This means that, in most cases, if a loss is suffered, the homeowner will not have to go to court and will be reimbursed relatively quickly.
 
What is not covered by title insurance?
What is not covered by title insurance will depend on the type of policy that is purchased, as well as what caused the loss. Some things that may be excluded are:

title defects already known at the time that the insurance was purchased,
environmental hazards,
Native land claims,
liens not included in public records, (e.g. unregistered encroachments), and
zoning infractions committed by the policyholder.

As with all types of insurance, it is important to read the policy carefully and make sure you understand exactly what is and is not covered.
 
What are the different types of title insurance?
In addition to the different types of coverage, there are also different types of title insurance policies available. Two general categories of policies are Owner’s Policy and Lender’s Policy. The Owner’s Policy protects the owner from different kinds of title-related losses that are listed in the policy. It will set a maximum amount of coverage, which is usually the value of the property. The Lender’s Policy protects the lender, such as a bank, in case the mortgage is invalid or unenforceable. Generally, a Lender’s Policy provides coverage only for the amount of the mortgage.
For residential properties, the various types of insurance include: new homeowner and existing homeowner policies, and policies for lenders in a residential mortgage. For commercial (business) properties, title insurance policies are available for individuals who are purchasing commercial properties, and policies for lenders in a commercial mortgage.
Once title insurance is purchased, it remains valid for as long as you own the property. You do not need to renew it or purchase more insurance unless the value of your property increases beyond the policy limit. In that case, you may decide to purchase additional insurance to cover the increase in value. Also, the cost of the insurance is a relatively small, one-time fee (called a premium) of about $300 – $500 depending on the insurance company you choose and the value of the property. Since, in addition to the insurance protection that title insurance provides, it also eliminates the need for many administrative searches, the cost of title insurance will be offset by the reduced search fees.

Failing to have adequate insurance on your property
Failing to pay property taxes
Putting another mortgage on the property
Failing to keep the premises in a reasonable state of repair
Selling the property without the bank’s consent

Because the home is the bank’s security for the mortgage loan, it has an interest in maintaining the home’s value. Failing to have proper insurance or failing to pay property taxes, for example, can jeopardize the value of the property.
 
What happens if you default on your mortgage?
Financial institutions have a number of options once a mortgage has gone into default. The bank or mortgage company may first send you reminder letters or call. It will usually send you a demand letter, which demands payment of the outstanding balance. If you fail to pay, the bank can eventually take possession of the property and sell it under the terms of the mortgage agreement or by foreclosure. Any costs incurred by the lender when selling your home is added to the amount you already owe.
If you cannot make the mortgage payments, but your home is worth more than the outstanding balance of the mortgage loan, you may want to sell the property yourself. This way, you will be able to pay off the financial institution and still keep the equity, which is the difference between the loan and the amount you received when it sold.
Defaulting on your mortgage can lead to a range of serious consequences. If you are experiencing financial difficulties, before allowing a default to occur, it is a good idea to contact the institution that holds your mortgage.
If you cannot make your mortgage payments and cannot reach some agreement with your financial institution to deal with the situation, you should seek advice from a lawyer. Your lawyer may be able to delay or prevent you from losing your home.

Because the home is the bank’s security for the mortgage loan, it has an interest in maintaining the home’s value. Failing to have proper insurance or failing to pay property taxes, for example, can jeopardize the value of the property.
 
What happens if you default on your mortgage?
Financial institutions have a number of options once a mortgage has gone into default. The bank or mortgage company may first send you reminder letters or call. It will usually send you a demand letter, which demands payment of the outstanding balance. If you fail to pay, the bank can eventually take possession of the property and sell it under the terms of the mortgage agreement or by foreclosure. Any costs incurred by the lender when selling your home is added to the amount you already owe.
If you cannot make the mortgage payments, but your home is worth more than the outstanding balance of the mortgage loan, you may want to sell the property yourself. This way, you will be able to pay off the financial institution and still keep the equity, which is the difference between the loan and the amount you received when it sold.
Defaulting on your mortgage can lead to a range of serious consequences. If you are experiencing financial difficulties, before allowing a default to occur, it is a good idea to contact the institution that holds your mortgage.
If you cannot make your mortgage payments and cannot reach some agreement with your financial institution to deal with the situation, you should seek advice from a lawyer. Your lawyer may be able to delay or prevent you from losing your home.
